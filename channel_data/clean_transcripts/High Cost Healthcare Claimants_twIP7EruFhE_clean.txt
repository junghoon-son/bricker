Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is high healthcare costs. We are going to discuss the number one cause of high healthcare costs. And that number one cause is high cost claimants. Now, many of you are familiar with the 80-20 rule, which means that 80% of claims costs are driven by only 20% of the claimants. And typically those claimants over the course of a year have in excess of $25,000 of claims. That's an approximation. It varies by group. Likewise, there's also the 55 rule or the 550 rule where 50% of the claims costs are in the top 5% of the healthcare costs claimants.

And those claimants typically have greater than $100,000 in collective claims over the course of the year. So essentially this 5% here is a subset of this 20% here. Now, this video today is what literally everybody who has any impact on an employer-sponsored health plan budget needs to think about every day. If you are a benefits manager, if you are a director of comp and benefits or total rewards, if you're a VP of HR, if you are a CFO, if you're a broker, if you're a consultant, this, if you think about something when you wake up in the morning related to your health plan costs, this is what you need to think about.

It is the high cost claimants. You can watch this video every morning to remind you of on your plan, high cost claimants are going on as you sit there. What are you going to do about it? I've noticed in many of my conversations with employers and broker consultants, it's very easy to get distracted by all these other things that are going on in your health plan. You've got plan design issues. You've got compliance issues. You've got a noise from an employee or an executive who's having a particular problem.

You're having file issues with your data vendor or with your carrier. There's a gazillion distractions. Those distractions will always be there. They will never go away. But we all need to cut through those distractions and every single day say to ourselves, what are we doing to address our high cost claims? Because unless you do something about your high cost claimants, you will not do anything about your health care costs. You have to address your high cost claimants. Now, in order to do that, we need to understand our high cost claimants.

They are in three diagnostic categories of musculoskeletal. And this is important because when you look at the diagnostic categories for ICD-10 codings, typically they roll them up into various categories. There's one category called musculoskeletal, called MSK. So that's pretty obvious. However, there's another section, uh, category that needs to be added to that. And that is injury and poisoning. Because you almost have no members on your plan that have poison. Fortunately, poisoning is exceedingly rare. So it shouldn't even be called this, right? Because the poison is like nothing.

It's injury. Aha! It's not always because the diagnosis coding is not exact. Like it's not just fractures. Like there are absolutely longer term musculoskeletal issues that are in injury that can be addressed by employers and brokers and consultants and health plans. So don't leave out injury. Don't think, oh, you know, it's just people having fractures. There's nothing we can do about it. Like there are absolutely things that you can do. And so it, what looks to be your MSK spend is actually artificially low unless you look at the injury spend as well.

Point number two, diagnostic two, cardiovascular. When you look at cardiovascular, you need to look at heart attacks. You need to look also at congestive heart failure. You also need to look at peripheral vascular disease. You also need to look at cerebrovascular disease, otherwise known as stroke. Now, you also need to look at, at the end of the day, your diabetes spend and your renal spend, your kidney spend, are actually in cardiovascular. Because kidney failure, nine times out of ten, is not because of the problem with the kidney itself.

It's a result of vascular damage within the kidney. Number one, cause diabetes. Number two, cause hypertension, which is the same pathologic process that's going on in the heart and the brain. You can think of kidney failure for somebody with diabetes or hypertension as essentially analogous to like a heart attack of the kidney or a stroke of the kidney. It happens much slower, but it's that it's that same process of damaged blood vessels. Now, a handful of times it's because you might have like polycystic kidney disease.

So, it can occasionally be because of the actual, what's referred to as the stroma and the parenchyma of the kidney, but the vast majority of time it's due to the vascular problems in the kidney. Diagnose number three, category number three, is cancer. With the big ones being breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Now, it's not all those cancers, but those are the big ones. Sometimes you'll have liver cancer, sometimes you'll have leukemia or lymphoma, so you'll get some other ones in there.

But you need to think about musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and cancer every single day. If there is a day that goes by where you don't think about your plan of how are you going to address the pain and suffering and healthcare and healthcare costs of these three diagnostic categories, you're getting distracted. You have to think about these things because guess what? If you don't think about them, they will not solve themselves and they will get worse. Next up, in those high cost claimants, they are not a homogeneous population.

They are heterogeneous. So we are now going to discuss the heterogeneity of high cost claimants. How's that for a topic? Two-thirds of high cost claimants are new yearly. I'm going to say that again. Two-thirds of high cost claimants are new every year. And so what I've done here is I've drawn a pie chart. And there you've got O for old high cost claimants. So in other words, you'll have a third of your high cost claimants this year are the same people that were high cost claimants the previous year. They're just continuing on with their high cost claimants, being high cost claimants.

So you have two-thirds then that are new. So just understand that you have two categories. Now, new is then broken down into two more categories. So you essentially have a total of three categories. Old and then new part one and new part two. We're going to go over each of them right now. So this, which represents half of your new high cost claimants and the majority of your new high cost claimants are people who had almost zero claims before they became high cost claimants. So I've shown this graphically here where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is dollar amount.

And there's nothing, nothing, nothing. And then wham, how does that end up? They end up having musculoskeletal related to a, uh, typically a major spine surgery. They might not have tried any non-invasive things before and they just end up in the office of an orthopedist or a neurosurgeon. It's like, bam, they're taken straight to the OR. Also cardiovascular, again, heart attack, stroke out of nowhere, new cancer diagnosis and otherwise healthy person. I have seen this tragedy over and over and over again. For some reason it happens, it tends to be people in their forties with colon cancer that's already metastatic to their liver or their lungs.

I have seen that so much and they're totally fine. Like they're totally gone about their life, healthy, 45, married, kids. I mean, it is a tragedy. Okay. So almost, what does that mean? That means, so that entire strategy of like, Hey, we're going to target the high cost claimants a priori. You can't do that. You can't analyze your claims data to identify these high cost claimants in advance because there are no claims. So this whole idea that you are somehow going to use your claims data to target these people is going to miss half your high cost claimants.

Let me say that again. Claims analytics to try to identify people and contact them beforehand is going to not work for half your high cost claims because they don't generate claims. There is nothing to analyze. If there is nothing to analyze, then you will miss them, which is why I talk about primary care, primary care, primary care, and primary care. You can get it through an on-site clinic, an near-site clinic. You can get it through direct primary care. You can get it through virtual primary care. I don't care how you get it, but half of your high cost claimants, this is the biggest opportunity for you right now.

All these people, no claims. Don't, don't even bother with the analytics. They have no claims. Next up, the old model. We used to think that all your high cost claims were like this. Well, look, they just trend up over time with these chronic diseases, right? Chronic diseases, yeah, blah, blah, blah. Right. But those people have to generate claims. Okay. Typically people who have progressive diabetes and have diabetic nephropathy, before they end up going on to dialysis, it does tend to trend over time. So that classic situation of where you actually can use claims.

So here you can use your analytics, use your analytics here, is to identify people who are going to go into renal failure. You should be able to know, identify these people 100% of the time. There should never be a person who goes into renal failure on your plan where you didn't know about it in advance. The only time you would have not known about it in advance is if you had somebody just come onto your plan because of a new hire. And typically because it's a spouse, because these people are on disability and that spouse comes on your plan because you hired somebody.

Okay. But otherwise you should know. Okay. Third area, your old ones, who stay on. In other words, here's time, here's money. So in other words, they're just high. Now, a prior cancer, right? So they have cancer, it recurs or it metastasizes, right? So they were high the previous year and then it comes right back. Or they have heart failure. Now, not a lot of people, heart failure is a big deal for the Medicare population, but there are some people that have heart failure that are in the employer-sponsored population.

These heart failure guys, I mean, they're on drips at home. They get hospitalized a ton of times. They get put on this device called an LVAD as kind of a bridge to a heart transplant. And even after they get a transplant, they're still very high healthcare costs. So heart failure and then a musculoskeletal surgery with a complication. So this is where those spine surgeries, oftentimes they still have pain after their spine surgery. Guess what they do? They go in for another surgery or they have all these issues, right? Likewise, if you need to have a joint replacement that then ends up having a revision.

I've even seen two or three revisions on these. Okay. Now, point is, is that they don't just come on, right? In order for half the people to be new, then you'll also have high cost payments coming off, right? So they spike and they generate in excess of $100,000 a year or $50,000 or $25,000 depending upon where you want to set your threshold. But then they come off. What are the three ways they come off? They leave the plan, because either the employee or the employee leaves and either the employee themselves had the health issue or their dependent spouse had the health issue.

So they leave. That's one way you can go off. You know, that's just kind of, that's just kind of random, right? You can't have their healthcare impact them, you know, leaving or being fired, etc. Right? So that's just kind of random. Can't really impact that. Okay. Next up, they expire. Listen, at the end of the day, some people succumb to their, their illness and they die. At Compass, we had one of our members die like once a week and we had one to two people where we were helping them find hospice. We were helping one to two people a week find a hospice as well.

We were just, I mean, we were taking care of a ton of people. And so, I mean, that, you know, such, you know, such is life. We are all terminally ill. So you will have these people come off your plan when they expire. Okay. Next up, these you could resolve. Are there people that have cancer? Like that is, it's very, and it could, it could not come back for decades, if at all. There are absolutely people that have definite carcinoma inside two or stage one cancer, even stage two breast cancer. It does not come back at all.

Same way with colon cancer. Look, I've, I've met these people. I know these people who had colon cancer. There was even local extension and they were treated very well. And it's been gone for like 20 years. I mean, it's awesome. So listen, that, they can resolve. Likewise, with the dialysis, they can get a kidney transplant or they can go on, well, in this case, it's a financial resolution, but they can go on Medicare. So they're not on your plan anymore. So their dialysis didn't resolve, but you don't have to pay for it anymore because Medicare is paying for it.

Same thing with a heart failure or the MSK complications. They can also have the same thing as well. They can leave the plan, they can expire or it can resolve too. So just know this again, literally every day you need to think about this because if you're not thinking about this, you're not going to solve it. So I just wanted to make a video to remind you. Oh, that's all I wanted to do. Just remind you. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z. I'm trying anti-coldo flushing anti-crazy. I just wanted to go out for this.

So let me understand all that actually I'm going to turn them on last night and be able to hear it seminar. Thank you, professor. So since I talked to each other, well, we have someone who is למ�グ shoes. I just wanted to apply them on for the thing. I guess it JUMP here in оф..
