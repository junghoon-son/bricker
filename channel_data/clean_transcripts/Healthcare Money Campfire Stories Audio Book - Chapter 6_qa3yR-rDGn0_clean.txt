Healthcare Money Campfire Stories by Eric Bricker, M.D. Chapter 6. I Can't Read. Mr. D. was a man in his mid-70s. He was a widower but had remarried for about seven years to Mrs. D. He was a patient of mine in my outpatient clinic at the East Baltimore Medical Center, EBMC, about two miles away from Johns Hopkins Hospital. EBMC was a two-story brick outpatient facility owned by Johns Hopkins that housed clinics for internal medicine, pediatrics, and OBGYN. I saw patients there one afternoon per week. Mr. D. had diabetes requiring insulin, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.

I saw Mr. D. regularly for tweaks in his medication regimen. About half the time he came on his own, the other times he came with his wife. Mr. D. was beyond pleasant, smiling, upbeat, and always chuckling about something. Mrs. D. was about 20 years younger than Mr. D. and was even more pleasant. Mr. D. was retired. He worked for the railroad, as he put it, for over 40 years. He had lived in Baltimore his whole life. I had a hard time getting Mr. D.'s diabetes and blood pressure under control. His numbers were okay, but not great. A blood test that measureds the average level of his blood sugar over the course of 90 days, called a hemoglobin A1c, measured 8.2.

The goal is less than 7. Mr. D.'s blood pressure was consistently around 150 over 80. The top number, the systolic blood pressure, was too high. The goal for the systolic blood pressure is less than 135 for a person with diabetes. During one visit, I examined him and we tweaked his medications again. Mrs. D. was with him. She had brought me a gift, a plain black baseball cap that she had bought at the street market just down the hill from Johns Hopkins Hospital. How awesome is that? It's the first present I had ever received from a patient.

I wore it for about three years until it was falling apart. While I was thanking Mrs. D. for the hat, Mr. D. interrupted and said, Hey, we gotta go. Okay, I replied. It was a little unusual for Mr. D. to be in a hurry, but I didn't think much of it. I walked out of the exam room with them. The typical process was to stop by the clerk's desk on the way out to schedule the next appointment. Mr. D. said he did not have time for that now and would call later. What's the rush? I asked. I need to catch the bus to go to school, he replied.

Go to school? Mr. D., you're retired. Why are you going to school? I said in an almost joking manner as I patted him on the back. He continued to walk towards the door. I can't read, he said with a smile. He was not embarrassed to say it. I immediately thought about his career at the railroad. Mr. D., you mean to tell me you worked at the railroad for 40 years and you don't know how to read? Yep, he replied. He put on his own cap that he was holding, shook my hand, and walked to the elevator. Mrs. D. smiled, shook my hand as well, and followed him.

On subsequent visits, I came to learn that Mr. D., like so many people who can't read, had created ways over the years of getting around his illiteracy. Regarding his medicine, Mrs. D. took care of everything for him. She drew up his insulin and then passed him the syringe. She gave him his pills. She did all the cooking and grocery shopping. When it came to Mr. D.'s diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, Mrs. D. ran the show. No wonder I had been having difficulty getting his conditions under control. Every time Mr.

D. came to a visit without Mrs. D., the test results, medication changes, and dietary instructions were printed for Mr. D. But he couldn't read them. He would take them home to Mrs. D., and she would do the best she could to follow them without any clarification. I noticed that every time Mrs. D. came to the appointments, she always asked a ton of questions. I decided Mrs. D. had to be there every time. How could I have not picked up on that? The plan from now on was for Mrs. D. to come with Mr. D. to his appointments. As expected, Mr.

D.'s numbers improved. Hemoglobin A1c down to 7.5, and his blood pressure was down to around 140 over 80. Fast forward to near the end of my third and final year of residency. I was on an ICU rotation in the hospital. I had just finished a night of being on call and was headed out of the hospital around 1 p.m. the next day. While walking down the hall, I ran into one of my fellow senior residents who was on the general medicine wards for the month. She told me my clinic patient, Mr. D., had been admitted several days prior for a CHF exacerbation.

He had some excess fluid removed with diuretics, and some of his blood pressure medications had to be adjusted too. He was doing well and was set to be discharged in a day. She added, He says really nice things about you. I smiled to myself. That was just Mr. D. being pleasant as always. I asked if his wife had been with him. Yes, the resident said. What floor is he on? Osler 4. That's the name of one of the telemetry floors where patients go with CHF exacerbations. I went to see Mr. D. on my way out of the hospital. He was resting.

I touched his shoulder and called his name. He opened his eyes, smiled, and reached up to shake my hand. He looked good. It was odd to see him in a hospital gown. He was one of the few patients I was able to keep out of the hospital during my residency. We talked. It turned out, for his birthday, he and his wife went to Atlantic City for the weekend to gamble. They had indulged in several all-you-can-eat buffets. Who could blame him? It was his birthday. The day after he returned home, he had trouble breathing overnight.

He had to sit upright to catch his breath, a classic sign of fluid overload in a CHF exacerbation. The buffet food probably had a lot of sodium, which caused him to retain fluid and led to his shortness of breath. We chatted a little more. He chuckled as always. We said goodbye. As I left the room, I remembered I should probably tell the senior resident something. I sat down at a computer at the nurse's station. Johns Hopkins had a text paging system so I could send the resident a message through the computer to her pager as a text.

Be careful when you discharge Mr. D. He can't read. I typed. I clicked send. I got up and began the 10-minute walk out of the massive hospital and to the parking garage. During the walk, I received a text page back from the resident. Thanks. I had no idea. Lesson learned. High or low quality care is often not a function of money. Patient outcomes are often not a function of money. Quality and outcomes are a function of healthcare professionals effectively interacting with patients and their families. Quality and outcomes are a function of time, attention, understanding, and skill repeated over and over again to understand patients' lives.

The technical term for this understanding their lives is called social determinants of health. Healthcare is a services business. Understanding and addressing those social determinants of health is a major part of that services business. It's those one-on-one interactions where high quality care and positive outcomes can be found. It's in the interpersonal details. Today's work is a participant. 나타� if bienven.
