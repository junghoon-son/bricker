High-deductible plans are increasingly common, but if you are a doctor, they are bad news. Join me as I take a look at why doctors need to steer clear of these types of plans and share with you some tips about how best to do that. I'm Dr. Eric Bricker, and I'm also a healthcare finance expert. I know how doctors get taken advantage of financially, and that's why I've partnered with KnowMeHealth to share with you what I know. This is Healthcare Uncovered. Did you know that 29% of people who have commercial health insurance through their job are now on high-deductible health plans? That's up from 19% just 10 years ago.

The average individual deductible for one of these insurance plans is about $2,500 per year, and the average individual out-of-pocket maximum is about $5,300 per year. These plans have a lot of out-of-pocket costs for patients. As a result, doctors must expect their patients to pay at the time of service for office visits, tests, and procedures. According to the Medical Group Management Association, the Trade Association for Physician Practice Managers, 59% of doctor practices have seen an increase in patients with high-deductible insurance plans.

The high out-of-pocket costs for high-deductible insurance plans has met a big disconnect between what patients expect to pay and the medical bills they actually receive. 50% of patients on a high-deductible health plan report receiving surprise medical bills, that is, bills they were never expecting to pay in the first place. As a result, 34% of patients report being harassed by a bill collector, and 44% report financial hardship from their medical bills. High-deductible plans have also been a challenge for physician practices.

Almost one-quarter of practices say that at least 10% of their patient accounts have bad debt associated with them, and the majority have between 3% and 9%. So, what can physician practices do to care for their patients, manage their patients' expectations, and still get paid? Here are four ideas. One, give patients the ability to pay online. Even in today's world, less than half of practices offer an online payment option for patients. Two, have a credit card on file for all your patients. Practices that do so can lower their accounts receivable by 28%.

Three, offer payment plans over multiple months. Four, improve your communication with your patients. While it may be unpleasant to talk about the cost of an office visit, test, or procedure, it's super important to manage the expectations of your patients and be able to give them a good-faith estimate up front. Note, there are still many non-high-deductible plans out there. To the extent you can have more patients not on these plans, you will have fewer financially stressed patients and more cash flow for your practice.

And that's another reason why I recommend doctors look at networks that pay you in full so you don't have to deal with deductibles at all. One plan I often recommend is the Nomi Health Open Network.
