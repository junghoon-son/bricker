Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today we're going to talk about the healthcare quadrilateral, which is just a fancy way of saying the four participants in employed healthcare. Now this is a very busy diagram that we're looking at, but we're going to break it down. So first we have the employer and the insurance company. And so the employer pays premium to the insurance company and then the insurance company in return provides a policy to the employer. Now we have the employee down here and the employer provides coverage to the employee and their family.

And then the employee then typically pays a part of their paycheck, which is referred to as the premium contribution that goes towards the premium that's paid to the insurance company. Now of course the employee then needs to go see the doctor or go to the hospital, have medical services, etc. And that comes from the provider. Okay, and then they receive care from the provider and then the employee will typically pay like a copay or what's referred to as the out-of-pocket cost to the provider. Now the provider will then submit a bill to the insurance company and then the insurance company will then remit payment back to the provider.

And so in healthcare it's very easy to get confused with all the different moving parts. And so it's very helpful to think about it in terms of this framework of the employer, insurance company, employee, and provider. And with that, thank you so much for watching A Healthcare Z and we'll see you next time..
