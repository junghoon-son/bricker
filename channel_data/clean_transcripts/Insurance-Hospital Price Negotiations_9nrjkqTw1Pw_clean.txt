Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and welcome to A Healthcare Z. Today we're going to be discussing insurance hospital contracting. And so I'm going to take you to the negotiating table between the insurance network and a hospital system. So this is where the insurance company will sit down with hospital A and hospital A will say, hey, we want $2,000 for every single MRI that we perform. And the insurance company says, well, that's pretty high, so you need to give us something somewhere else in the contract. So the hospital comes back and says, okay, but we'll do something like a knee surgery for only $6,000.

Insurance company says, okay, well, that's a pretty good deal. Now the insurance company goes across town to hospital B and has the exact opposite conversation. So this is where hospital B says, okay, well, we'll take $800 for every MRI that we perform. And the insurance network says, oh, that's great. That's a really good deal. But hospital B comes back and says, hey, we want $14,000 for every single knee surgery that we perform. And the network says, well, okay, you drive a really hard bargain, but we'll agree to that as well.

And so people will say to me, hey, Dr. Bricker, which hospital is the most cost effective in town? And the answer is, is it depends. So in some cases, the hospital that'll be most cost effective for a surgery at one location will actually be the most expensive for imaging and vice versa. So this is just the beginning of how insurance networks and hospitals negotiate their contracts. Thanks so much for watching..
