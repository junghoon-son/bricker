Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today we're going to discuss the top five largest healthcare consulting firms in America. So we here on A Healthcare Z talk about healthcare finance. We cannot talk about healthcare finance and the healthcare industry without talking about healthcare consulting firms because they are filled with strategic and operational direction for hospitals and health plans and many other actors in healthcare. So we have to understand who these healthcare consulting firms are.

The A number one largest one is probably a name that you're familiar with. This is according to modern healthcare. They did these rankings. It's Deloitte. Now of course Deloitte is a huge accounting firm and then within Deloitte they have a huge consulting practice and so the consulting practice within Deloitte is a $2.7 billion a year revenue business. Now the healthcare part within Deloitte consulting because they consult on other industries as well is $963 million a year in revenue. So you take the $963 million divided by the $2.7 billion.

That means that about 36% of Deloitte consulting's revenue is from healthcare consulting. Now what type of healthcare consulting do they do? One of the main areas of healthcare consulting that all of these consulting firms do is something that is referred to as revenue cycle management or just rev cycle or RCM. What is revenue cycle management? It's billing and collections. Now they call it a cycle because it starts all the way with admitting and pre-registration making sure you got the right information on the patient making sure you have the right insurance information checking to make sure that their insurance still is covering them see how their benefits are whether it's a covered or a non-covered service what's their deductible what's their co-insurance blah blah blah then it's collecting all of the charges that happen in the hospital it's then taking all those charges and then translating that into a bill it's then taking that bill and actually getting it out the door to Medicare Medicaid or a commercial insurance company like Blue Cross United Cigna or Aetna and then it's a matter of collections following up with Medicare Medicaid Blue Cross United Cigna to then actually get paid and then posting the cash so that it's actually on the books and that entire process is thought of as a cycle or the revenue cycle so this revenue cycle management essentially the end result is to have hospitals get paid more faster so Deloitte among other consulting services helps hospitals get paid more faster next up GuideHouse probably a name that many of you are not familiar with it was the combination of a large healthcare consulting firm called Navigant plus a division within PricewaterhouseCoopers plus they added some additional acquisitions of other consulting firms as well now they do a total of 970 million in consulting revenue again they do other industries besides healthcare but about half of their consulting revenue does come from healthcare so about 485 million a year in revenue comes from GuideHouse's healthcare consulting now interestingly again they are the second largest specifically for revenue cycle management for this rev cycle consulting they're the second largest firm in America for that they've done these consulting projects for over 250 hospitals in America and GuideHouse as a total company is about 7,000 employees which let's just say so about half their revenue comes from healthcare so let's just say half their employees work on healthcare products that means that they have about 3,500 healthcare consultants that work at GuideHouse that's an approximation but then that gives you an idea about you know how many healthcare consultants they probably have at Deloitte right because Deloitte is doing about is doing 963 million which is about twice as much as the 485 million that GuideHouse is doing so Deloitte probably has about twice as many consultants as GuideHouse does so Deloitte probably has about 7,000 healthcare consultants so when we're thinking about the size of these consulting firms I'm just trying to give you some context both in terms of revenue and the number of employees and the types of consulting projects that they do okay next up interesting Optum is the third largest healthcare consulting firm in America now all of these when I say healthcare consulting this is on the provider side they do provider consulting and obviously the majority of the money on the provider side is on the hospital side so you can almost think of these as like hospital consultants isn't that interesting Optum is the third largest hospital consultant in America now it's obviously it's a part of UnitedHealth Group now they said that they did 755 million in total consulting which is kind of weird right because that's more than number two but I think the reason that they're ranked number three is that because Optum actually does a lot of consulting for health insurance companies as well and so if you took out that health insurance company consulting and you just look at the provider consulting because they absolutely do consulting for hospital services as well then that puts them at number three now do they do rev cycle consulting absolutely Optum has a consulting service that helps hospitals get paid more faster now wait a second if you have UnitedHealthcare as your administrative services only isn't isn't isn't isn't UnitedHealthcare going to be telling you the employer that we're going to help lower your healthcare costs right because essentially if a hospital is getting paid more faster the end result for that for an employer is that their healthcare costs will go up faster so that seems to be a conflict of interest when you have one part of UnitedHealth Group's business trying to increase healthcare costs by helping hospitals and yet you have another part of the same company that's trying to do the exact opposite that seems to be a conflict now they specifically work in areas of charge capture and coding optimization in other words trying to make the bills be larger that are going out and also specifically on the revenue cycle optimization that's the faster part getting paid faster so let's look at a specific example the Georgia state employees use UnitedHealthcare as their plan administrator your health insurance if you work for the state of Georgia is through UnitedHealthcare well there are major hospital systems in in Georgia as well well well star Piedmont Emory so if Optum and their consulting group was going out to well star or Piedmont or Emory like if the Optum consultants were doing a really good job that would end up costing the state of Georgia more money so I guess would the Optum consultants have to recuse themselves from having to work with a hospital system in Georgia because the same company administers the employee benefit plan for the state employees I don't know but that appears to be a conflict of interest okay next up you've got Vizient what is Vizient it's actually a group purchasing organization it's one of the largest the big two premier and Vizient are the big two GPOs they do group purchasing for hospitals whether it be for software but also for things like um like like their like laundry services like their sheets okay so they do all this group purchasing for hospitals but then they have a consulting arm within Vizient that actually does 210 million dollars a year in consulting again and they do revenue cycle consulting for hospital systems as well and the number five here on the list is the Huron consulting group that does 378 million dollars in uh annual consulting revenue now keep in mind believe it or not when I started out uh right out of college I was a hospital consultant and I specifically worked on revenue cycle management programs so and I specifically worked for a company called Stock Campus and Associates that was bought a long time ago by Huron so if you go on my LinkedIn profile you will see that it says that I used to work for Huron because I worked for a company that was acquired by Huron now keep in mind this was back in the late 90s this was over 22 years ago but yes I used to work for and I still know people that work at Huron to this day that work on revenue cycle management uh projects for hospitals to help those hospitals get paid more faster that's the goal now notice who is not on this list who's not on this list is McKinsey now of course McKinsey is a private company but McKinsey does absolutely a ton of healthcare consulting now they do it for hospitals but they also do it for health insurance companies and they also do consulting for pharmaceutical companies as well they obviously do a lot of strategy consulting because they're a private company they tend to be much quieter about their revenue and who their customers are so it's harder to figure this stuff out but just know that McKinsey absolutely has a healthcare systems and services practice now what's my punchline for today we have all these people working in healthcare consulting my one wish for all of these people is that instead of doing consulting projects on revenue cycle to improve charge capture and coding optimization wouldn't it be great if these healthcare consultants worked on clinical optimization to decrease the variability in cost and quality that exists within a hospital system we know that healthcare is highly variable by physicians we know that healthcare is very is highly variable by specific facility these hospital systems have dozens of facilities dozens of hospitals dozens of ambulatory surgery centers dozens of outpatient clinics there's massive amounts of clinical variability where one patient will be treated very different than another patient with the exact same condition in the exact same scenario depending upon which hospital they go to within the same health system depending upon which clinic they go to within the same health system and frankly a lot of the expertise of these consultants could help these hospitals improve this so my one wish if i were to snap my fingers is that we could get all of these healthcare consultants to help hospitals with their clinical optimization to help with clinical improvement programs i think it would be time well spent and that's my point for today thank you for watching a healthcare z.
