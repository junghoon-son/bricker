 Hello this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is Profit Pool Consultants and Decreasing Healthcare Costs. So it's based off of a research report from McKinsey & Company which many of you are familiar with but it's essentially one of the smartest management consulting firms known as the leader in the world. It has 127 offices worldwide. It is 27,000 employees. They make 10 billion dollars of revenue per year and they work in industries from technology to retail to transportation to of course healthcare as well. Now the most recent report on healthcare that they've published is called the evolution of healthcare provider profit pools. Say that 10 times fast. Okay but this is a fantastic research report. I will leave a link to it in the show notes. I encourage you to read it. They make a very interesting point. They say that 55% of future healthcare profit pools and they're saying through 2021 so they're basically looking at 2017 through 2021 are saying are non-hospital. Non-hospital. That's interesting. What do they mean by that? They mean that 34% of the 55% in other words 34% of the profit growth for healthcare providers will come in the form of on-site clinics, telehealth, primary care providers, behavioral health, retail, PT and OT which is occupational therapy and physical therapy, home health, ambulatory surgery centers, and dialysis. Okay isn't that interesting? The largest areas of provider profit growth are in areas that are meant to decrease healthcare costs, right? So on-site telehealth, using primary care behavior, all these things are meant to reduce the use of expensive hospital-based services or prevent people from ever meeting them in the first place. Likewise, PT-OT is an alternative to like expensive orthopedic surgeries. Home health is a cheaper location and by ASC they mean non-hospital-owned ASCs. Independent ASCs. And by dialysis, I think they mean dialysis centers that are independent and not part of like DaVita and Fresenius. In other words, they're more cost-effective, more reasonable contract rates with insurance carriers. Okay, so now let's look at the opposite end of the spectrum. Where do they think there is going to be the least amount of growth of profit for providers? They think it's going to be in freestanding ERs, imaging, lab, ambulance, chiropractor, skilled nursing facilities, and long-term acute care facilities or known as those LTACs. Isn't that interesting? Because freestanding ERs and imaging, those were the two sort of huge cash cows really put up for the past like five, ten years where the hospital systems really pushed down on making a lot, and also independent facilities really pushed down on making a lot of money there. So to a certain extent, they kind of burned out. It's being a little excessive. But there's an important warning. Of course, they don't they don't phrase it as a warning. They phrase it as an opportunity. But there is a very important warning at the bottom of this report. And it says that all of these areas of high profit growth create an opportunity for acquisition by the hospitals. Okay, so the whole point of the whole value proposition of these providers and their ability to, you know, make profits and grow revenue is based upon the fact that they're going to decrease utilization or decrease price or both to create higher value health care. Okay, if these agents are bought by a hospital, that essentially negates that value proposition. Because as I said in the previous video, and even in this research report, it says it creates a referral opportunity, it creates a referral opportunity, as I said in the previous video, to feed the beast. And I'll give you a specific example of that. So at Compass, we had a major client with like, in excess of 10,000 employees, that had a huge facility that had an on site clinic, and they had had it for years. And that on site clinic was actually a huge cost driver. They looked at people that were going down on site clinic, and it turned out that they ended up driving huge costs for their employee health plan. Why was that? Because the on site clinic was actually owned by the local hospital system. And so they were driving patient volume from that on site clinic, to the hospital for surgeries for lab for imaging. So the key here is that if these are going to be profit centers that have a value proposition of higher quality, more cost effective care, then to a certain extent, they need to remain separate from the hospital. And if you see them connected to the hospital, then that might need to be a warning sign that that is actually going to be increasing employer and patient health care costs and not decreasing it. And that's my point for today. Thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Thank you.

[0:00 - 0:05]  Hello this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's
[0:05 - 0:11]  topic is Profit Pool Consultants and Decreasing Healthcare Costs. So it's
[0:11 - 0:15]  based off of a research report from McKinsey & Company which many of you are
[0:15 - 0:19]  familiar with but it's essentially one of the smartest management consulting
[0:19 - 0:25]  firms known as the leader in the world. It has 127 offices worldwide. It is 27,000
[0:25 - 0:31]  employees. They make 10 billion dollars of revenue per year and they work in
[0:31 - 0:35]  industries from technology to retail to transportation to of course healthcare as
[0:35 - 0:39]  well. Now the most recent report on healthcare that they've published is
[0:39 - 0:43]  called the evolution of healthcare provider profit pools. Say that 10 times
[0:43 - 0:48]  fast. Okay but this is a fantastic research report. I will leave a link to it
[0:48 - 0:51]  in the show notes. I encourage you to read it. They make a very interesting point.
[0:51 - 0:57]  They say that 55% of future healthcare profit pools and they're saying through
[0:57 - 1:04]  2021 so they're basically looking at 2017 through 2021 are saying are non-hospital.
[1:04 - 1:10]  Non-hospital. That's interesting. What do they mean by that? They mean that 34% of
[1:10 - 1:16]  the 55% in other words 34% of the profit growth for healthcare providers will come
[1:16 - 1:21]  in the form of on-site clinics, telehealth, primary care providers, behavioral
[1:21 - 1:27]  health, retail, PT and OT which is occupational therapy and physical therapy, home
[1:27 - 1:32]  health, ambulatory surgery centers, and dialysis. Okay isn't that interesting? The
[1:32 - 1:40]  largest areas of provider profit growth are in areas that are meant to decrease
[1:40 - 1:46]  healthcare costs, right? So on-site telehealth, using primary care behavior, all
[1:46 - 1:54]  these things are meant to reduce the use of expensive hospital-based services or prevent
[1:54 - 1:58]  people from ever meeting them in the first place. Likewise, PT-OT is an alternative to
[1:58 - 2:03]  like expensive orthopedic surgeries. Home health is a cheaper location and by ASC they mean non-hospital-owned
[2:03 - 2:11]  ASCs. Independent ASCs. And by dialysis, I think they mean dialysis centers that are independent and not part of like
[2:11 - 2:16]  DaVita and Fresenius. In other words, they're more cost-effective, more reasonable
[2:16 - 2:21]  contract rates with insurance carriers. Okay, so now let's look at the opposite end of the
[2:21 - 2:25]  spectrum. Where do they think there is going to be the least amount of growth of profit for providers?
[2:25 - 2:31]  They think it's going to be in freestanding ERs, imaging, lab, ambulance, chiropractor, skilled nursing

[2:50 - 2:55]  facilities really pushed down on making a lot of money there. So to a certain extent, they kind of burned
[2:55 - 3:09]  out. It's being a little excessive. But there's an important warning. Of course, they don't they don't phrase it as a warning. They phrase it as an opportunity. But there is a very important warning at the bottom of this report. And it says
[3:09 - 3:24]  that all of these areas of high profit growth create an opportunity for acquisition by the hospitals. Okay, so the whole point of the whole value proposition of these providers and their ability to, you know, make profits and grow
[3:24 - 3:54]  revenue is based upon the fact that they're going to decrease utilization or decrease price or both to create higher value health care. Okay, if these agents are bought by a hospital, that essentially negates that value proposition. Because as I said in the previous video, and even in this research report, it says it creates a referral opportunity, it creates a referral opportunity, as I said in the previous video, to feed the beast. And I'll give you a specific example of that. So at Compass, we had a major
[3:54 - 4:24]  client with like, in excess of 10,000 employees, that had a huge facility that had an on site clinic, and they had had it for years. And that on site clinic was actually a huge cost driver.
