 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is, does money impact cancer doctor decisions? So today I'm going to go over an article by a Dr. Aaron Mitchell and his team. Now Dr. Aaron Mitchell is from a place called the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. And so like Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson in Houston are like the two most reputable cancer centers in America. I mean, they're like the Boston Celtics and the LA Lakers basketball teams like back in the 80s. Like they are the two top places. Okay. So this is not an Eric Bricker finding. This is from Dr. Aaron Mitchell from one of the most renowned cancer centers, frankly, in the world. Okay. And this was published in JAMA Oncology in 2019. Okay. And at the beginning of the article, Dr. Mitchell says, look, fee-for-service incentivizes doctors to do more treatments and to do more expensive treatments and more tests and procedures and more expensive tests and procedures. And look, 73% of doctors prefer fee-for-service. It's preferred by the vast majority of doctors. And 69% of doctors oppose bundled payments, which is kind of like a form of capitation sort of at the individual sort of episode of care level, whether it be like for a knee replacement or for a series of cancer treatments or what have you. Right? So, um, but 3% of doctors are like, look, money has no impact on my decision-making. So doctors don't think that money impacts, at least the surveyed doctors here, don't think that money impacts their decision-making. So Dr. Mitchell and his team said, look, okay, let's take a look at that. So they did what's called a meta-analysis where they looked at 18 studies specifically for cancer doctors, specifically for oncology. And they said, okay, let's look at these, let's review literally thousands of studies and let's kind of hone it down to like 18 specific studies that we felt were the best ones. And they found that seven of those studies were specifically on prostate cancer, four were on multiple types of cancers, three were about breast cancer, two were about lung cancer, one was about bladder cancer, and one was about colon cancer. And the results of their findings were, was that they found that there was an increase in radiation therapy, in other way, in other words, using very high powered x-ray beams to shrink or destroy the tumor when the doctors owned the radiation facility. And that's important because the doctor has the professional fee, but when they own the radiation facility, then the doctor practice also gets the facility fee. So in other words, the doctors would make more money when they owned the radiation facility. And, and at least this meta-analysis found that when the doctors did own the radiation facility, they tended to use radiation therapy more often. They used more treatments in more situations than when they didn't own the radiation therapy and were not collecting the facility fees. They also found that the oncologist used more expensive chemo, and that's important because oftentimes the physicians are actually paid based upon how expensive the chemo is that they are ordering. And so the more expensive the chemo, the more the doctors would get paid. So a specific example they cited was a chemotherapy that's called a renotecan, and it's used for colorectal cancer, that it was used a lot by oncologists. And then a renotecan became generic. And after it became generic, then oncologists started prescribing it less. So the oncologists were not getting paid as much because the renotecan was now generic. And so they were prescribing it less. Now, they also found that there was no impact on the oncologist's decision to actually give chemo or to not give chemo. So some people think, okay, well, the oncologist just wants to give chemo, period, because they're going to, they always want to give chemo, chemo, chemo, chemo, because they're going to get paid more just if they give chemo. And at least these researchers and these 18 studies found that that was not the case, that they did not find that oncologists were just giving chemo due to financial incentives. Now, they were giving more expensive chemo, but the decision to give or not to give chemo was not impacted by money, according to their research. Now, at the end of the article, it concludes with the ethics statement from the American Medical Association that says that physicians should never order unnecessary tests and procedures for the sake of their own remuneration or for the sake of the remuneration of a hospital or facility that they are associated with to the detriment of the patient. That the patient should always come first and the doctor should never do anything for the money. Okay. I think everybody agrees with that. Whether you're a doctor or you're a non-doctor, you would agree with that. And then the study goes on to conclude one more thing. It says, look, expecting physicians to practice blind to incentives is unrealistic. Okay. Newsflash. Doctors are human. Okay. Humans respond to incentives. Doctors are humans. Therefore, doctors respond to incentives. I don't think that is a crazy statement to make. Now, are there problems with other payment mechanisms? Sure. But to deny the fact that fee-for-service impacts physician decision-making when it comes to oncology is to deny the results of this study. And that's the point I wanted to make today.

[0:00 - 0:05]  Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is,
[0:06 - 0:14]  does money impact cancer doctor decisions? So today I'm going to go over an article by a Dr.
[0:14 - 0:20]  Aaron Mitchell and his team. Now Dr. Aaron Mitchell is from a place called the Memorial Sloan Kettering
[0:20 - 0:26]  Cancer Center in New York City. And so like Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson in
[0:26 - 0:32]  Houston are like the two most reputable cancer centers in America. I mean, they're like the
[0:32 - 0:37]  Boston Celtics and the LA Lakers basketball teams like back in the 80s. Like they are the two top
[0:37 - 0:45]  places. Okay. So this is not an Eric Bricker finding. This is from Dr. Aaron Mitchell from one of the most
[0:45 - 0:51]  renowned cancer centers, frankly, in the world. Okay. And this was published in JAMA Oncology in 2019.
[0:51 - 0:55]  Okay. And at the beginning of the article, Dr. Mitchell says, look, fee-for-service incentivizes
[0:55 - 1:02]  doctors to do more treatments and to do more expensive treatments and more tests and procedures
[1:02 - 1:08]  and more expensive tests and procedures. And look, 73% of doctors prefer fee-for-service. It's
[1:08 - 1:15]  preferred by the vast majority of doctors. And 69% of doctors oppose bundled payments, which is kind of
[1:15 - 1:21]  like a form of capitation sort of at the individual sort of episode of care level, whether it be like
[1:21 - 1:26]  for a knee replacement or for a series of cancer treatments or what have you. Right? So, um, but
[1:26 - 1:36]  3% of doctors are like, look, money has no impact on my decision-making. So doctors don't think that
[1:36 - 1:40]  money impacts, at least the surveyed doctors here, don't think that money impacts their decision-making.
[1:40 - 1:45]  So Dr. Mitchell and his team said, look, okay, let's take a look at that. So they did what's called a
[1:45 - 1:50]  meta-analysis where they looked at 18 studies specifically for cancer doctors, specifically for
[1:50 - 1:55]  oncology. And they said, okay, let's look at these, let's review literally thousands of studies and
[1:55 - 2:01]  let's kind of hone it down to like 18 specific studies that we felt were the best ones. And they
[2:01 - 2:06]  found that seven of those studies were specifically on prostate cancer, four were on multiple types of
[2:06 - 2:11]  cancers, three were about breast cancer, two were about lung cancer, one was about bladder cancer,
[2:11 - 2:17]  and one was about colon cancer. And the results of their findings were, was that they found that
[2:17 - 2:22]  there was an increase in radiation therapy, in other way, in other words, using very high powered
[2:22 - 2:31]  x-ray beams to shrink or destroy the tumor when the doctors owned the radiation facility. And that's
[2:31 - 2:36]  important because the doctor has the professional fee, but when they own the radiation facility,
[2:36 - 2:41]  then the doctor practice also gets the facility fee. So in other words, the doctors would make
[2:41 - 2:47]  more money when they owned the radiation facility. And, and at least this meta-analysis found that when
[2:47 - 2:54]  the doctors did own the radiation facility, they tended to use radiation therapy more often. They used
[2:54 - 2:59]  more treatments in more situations than when they didn't own the radiation therapy and were not
[2:59 - 3:06]  collecting the facility fees. They also found that the oncologist used more expensive chemo,
[3:06 - 3:11]  and that's important because oftentimes the physicians are actually paid based upon how
[3:11 - 3:17]  expensive the chemo is that they are ordering. And so the more expensive the chemo, the more the
[3:17 - 3:22]  doctors would get paid. So a specific example they cited was a chemotherapy that's called a
[3:22 - 3:29]  renotecan, and it's used for colorectal cancer, that it was used a lot by oncologists. And then a renotecan
[3:29 - 3:36]  became generic. And after it became generic, then oncologists started prescribing it less. So the
[3:36 - 3:42]  oncologists were not getting paid as much because the renotecan was now generic. And so they were
[3:42 - 3:48]  prescribing it less. Now, they also found that there was no impact on the oncologist's decision
[3:48 - 3:56]  to actually give chemo or to not give chemo. So some people think, okay, well, the oncologist just wants to give
[3:56 - 4:02]  chemo, period, because they're going to, they always want to give chemo, chemo, chemo, chemo, because they're going to get
[4:02 - 4:08]  paid more just if they give chemo. And at least these researchers and these 18 studies found that that was not the
[4:08 - 4:15]  case, that they did not find that oncologists were just giving chemo due to financial incentives. Now, they were giving more
[4:15 - 4:21]  expensive chemo, but the decision to give or not to give chemo was not impacted by money, according to their research. Now,
[4:22 - 4:31]  at the end of the article, it concludes with the ethics statement from the American Medical Association that says that
[4:31 - 4:41]  physicians should never order unnecessary tests and procedures for the sake of their own remuneration or for the sake of the
[4:41 - 4:48]  remuneration of a hospital or facility that they are associated with to the detriment of the patient. That the patient should always come
[4:48 - 4:56]  first and the doctor should never do anything for the money. Okay. I think everybody agrees with that. Whether you're a doctor or you're a
[4:56 - 5:03]  non-doctor, you would agree with that. And then the study goes on to conclude one more thing. It says, look, expecting physicians to
[5:03 - 5:11]  practice blind to incentives is unrealistic. Okay. Newsflash. Doctors are human.
[5:11 - 5:22]  Okay. Humans respond to incentives. Doctors are humans. Therefore, doctors respond to incentives. I don't think that is a crazy statement to make. Now, are there
[5:22 - 5:39]  problems with other payment mechanisms? Sure. But to deny the fact that fee-for-service impacts physician decision-making when it comes to oncology is to deny the results of this study. And that's the point I wanted to make today. And thank you for watching A Healthcare Z.
