  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is Confessions of a Hospital CFO. Now this video is based upon a YouTube video by a gentleman named Steve Phebus who is the CFO of Pullman Regional Hospital in Pullman, Washington, which is in far eastern Washington. It's like right on the Idaho border. Now this video has like 17,000 views and like over like 170 likes. So how in the world could a hospital CFO from rural Washington State have a YouTube video with close to like 20,000 views? It's unreal. And I'm going to leave a link in his show notes, but this video is of Mr. Phebus presenting to hospital board members, hospital physicians, other hospital executives. I mean it's a small hospital, so it's in like a small conference room, but he's just so frank and sincere. And look, I mean, Steve Phebus is a good guy and so we can learn so much when he talks straight about how a hospital CFO thinks. Now, like I said, Pullman Regional Hospital is a small hospital. It's a 25-bed hospital, which is referred to as a critical access hospital. And critical access hospitals actually max out at 25 beds. Once you have more than 25 beds, you're sort of no longer considered a critical access hospital. Okay. Now, he also says they do $117 million a year and build charges. And they make about $1 million in profit a year. Okay. He's very transparent about this. Now, most hospitals end up getting paid about 50 cents on the dollar. So they probably make about 60 million in revenue, which means that that profit margin there of 1 million is a little less than 2%, right? 1% of $60 million would be $600,000. So 2% would be like 1.2 million. So it's a little less than 2% profit margin, right? So they're not like rolling over in swaths of cash for profit margin. Now, interestingly, he also, on one of the slides, he breaks down where that revenue is coming from. It's 66% outpatient, 23% inpatient, and they own a handful of small physician groups. So it's 11% from the medical professional groups. Okay. So notice, again, the majority of the revenue for the hospital is for outpatient services. And this is true for most hospitals. So again, when we think about hospitals and hospital finance, we shouldn't think of them as making tons and tons of money from their inpatients. It's actually a ton of outpatient stuff. It's imaging, it's outpatient surgery, it's lab. Okay. Next up, he is very frank about the business model of a hospital. And he says, healthy patients are bad for business. Why? Well, listen, he calls it like he sees it. Because if you have healthy patients, nobody comes into the hospital. And when you have a fee for service based organization, if you don't have patient volume, then you don't have a hospital. So at the end of the day, he says, healthy patients are bad for business. He calls it like he sees it. Now, I will tell you in the same breath, he says, look, we do things to, we have outreach program, care coordination program, et cetera, et cetera, all this stuff to try to keep people healthy and keep people out of the hospital. He says, we try to do the right thing, but he says multiple times in this video that they have to do the right thing. And yet that is opposite to the financial model for the hospital itself, which is true, right? We all know that, that oftentimes it's the way that hospitals finances set up that quote unquote, doing the right thing for the patient actually ends up financially hurting the hospital. And he acknowledges this. Okay. Next up, he says to look at this little 25 bed hospital in rural Washington state. They've got a Da Vinci robot. They do robotic surgery. Why in the world with such a small hospital in such a small place, why do they need robotic surgery? Why? Okay. He explains because they needed to attract a urologist. They only had one urologist on staff. He was getting very senior. He was going to retire. And the only way that they could attract younger urologists coming out of their training was if they had the Da Vinci robot system that a lot of urologists train on in their residency program. Aha. So here you have a driver of healthcare costs, not being like necessarily like patient demand, but actually expensive healthcare technology as a physician recruitment tool. And that's an important dynamic that I think is, is, is remiss on a lot of people. And Mr. Phoebus points this out very specifically how a lot of times you have to use expensive technology just in order to be able to recruit and retain the physicians. Okay. Next up, MRI prices at Pullman were too high. And he said because their patients started having high deductible health plans, he says with deductibles of $1,500 that the patients started shopping around and the orthopedist came to him and said, look, we're not getting as many MRIs done here because they can go less than 10 miles away to a competing hospital and they can get the MRI done for a lot cheaper there. And they looked around at their prices and they were like the most expensive place in the area for MRIs. And guess what they did? They lowered the prices of their MRIs. Okay. So for everybody that says that price transparency and shopping doesn't work and make the market more efficient, here is a specific example of how a specific hospital in Washington lowered the prices of its MRIs because of the pressure from patients that were shopping on a high deductible health plan. Okay. We're not making this up. This literally happened. It is not esoteric academia. It happened. Okay. Next up, he admits that there is duplication of services at a competing hospital only nine miles away. So just across the border in Idaho, it's the town of Moscow, Idaho. I had never heard of Moscow, Idaho. It's where the University of Idaho is. Okay. Now, Pullman's got about, the town of Pullman, Washington, it's got about 35,000 people. And the town of Moscow is pretty similar. I think it's like 25,000 people. And both of these hospitals, the two towns are very close together. Again, less than 10 miles apart. They're only nine miles apart. Guess what they have? Full ER, full surgical suite, MRIs. And so there was actually talk in the past about trying to not have duplication of services between those two facilities. And the talks fell apart. So he's like, look, we've got duplication of stuff at these places. It's true. Now, next up, this is the key. This is probably one of the most golden things he says. He says, look, we staff for high volumes at our hospital, regardless of our census. Now, he says that, look, at a 25-bed hospital, he said, look, sometimes our census is two. Can you believe it? There's a hospital that will have two patients in it. And sometimes they'll have the full census. They'll have every bed booked at 25 patients. He says that they still pay the nurses regardless. And I think this needs to be said. I'm not trying to be mean or whatever. But when, listen, when the hospital census is down and people are still working, there's a lot of people sitting around. Okay. So are there times when it's very busy? Of course. Are there hospitals that are busy all the time? Of course. Are there hospitals at times where it's incredibly slow and people are just sitting there? Absolutely. And so, and the reason he says they still have to staff, so at other places, they might like cancel the nurses and not pay them. Oh, by the way, when they cancel their shift, they don't pay the nurse. He said, look, if we did that, the nurses would refuse to work at our place. They'd be like, look, we'll go work at a different hospital where they guarantee our salaries and they're not going to, you know, cut our shifts and cut our pay just based upon low patient volume. So from a staffing standpoint, they have to staff for the maximum occupancy of the hospital and their costs are not that variable when it comes to their staffing because of that. Why is this important? I told you earlier that they only made $1 million of profit. In other words, less than 2% profit margin. Okay. They could have made a much larger profit margin or they could have lowered their prices if they could have been more variable in their labor. So again, this $117 million of billed charges, the $60 million of revenue, a lot of it is going towards, it's a jobs program. It is a major employer in this town. So we're, and I'll leave a link in the show notes to talk about how a lot of the spend or the waste in healthcare is really job creation for people working in the healthcare field. Now, I'm not here to say that that is good, bad, or indifferent, but I am here to say that we need to confront that reality that if we talk about eliminating waste in healthcare, then we need to have the frank discussion of saying, look, that is going to eliminate healthcare jobs. Again, you know, it's a tough conversation to have, but we need to call a spade a spade. Okay. Final point I wanted to make. What does he say? Hospital prices are meaningless. You have a CFO of a hospital himself admit that hospital prices are meaningless. We've said this over and over again on A Healthcare C and here Steve Phoebus is saying the same thing. So I want to thank Steve for, you know, making a wonderful presentation. Again, please watch it. It's like an hour and a half long. You might just want to listen to it in the car, but that's the point I wanted to make today. And thank you for watching A Healthcare C.",
