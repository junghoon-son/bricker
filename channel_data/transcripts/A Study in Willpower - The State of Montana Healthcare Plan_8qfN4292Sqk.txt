 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today we're going to be discussing Will and Montana's Healthcare. So this is based on a story from NPR and ProPublica from October of 2018 and I will leave a link in the show notes. And this article is fantastic, so I thoroughly encourage you to read it. Okay, it's about a woman named Marilyn Bartlett who used to be a controller for a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and then she became the CFO of a company that administers health plans. And she was hired by the state of Montana's health plan which had 30,000 state employees and that health plan, it was going broke. And she made a bunch of changes in anticipation of a July 1 of 2016 plan change and we're going to talk about what those specific changes were and the results. Okay, what did she do? She went to the hospitals and she knew because she had worked for a Blue Cross plan, she knew about the huge variance in the prices that they had. So she went to them and she said, look we're going to do reference based pricing, we're going to give you Medicare plus X percent and you're going to take it and you're going to like it. And guess what they said? No, there was huge resistance. So she literally publicly shamed them across the state until she finally got like every single hospital in the state to agree to this. And what happened? That ended up saving the plan $15 million in 2018 and even more in the back half of 2016 and 2017. Okay. Oh, by the way, the plan spends about $200 million a year. Okay, great. Then she wasn't done there. She moved on to the PBM and she knew about the, let's just call them secretive deals that PBMs have. And she said, okay, we need a new PBM. So she got a new PBM that she eliminated the spread pricing because that new PBM was wanting to do that and the old PBM was not. And she got a full rebate pass through. So as a result of that, she was able to save $2 million per year from the no spread pricing and $3.5 million a year from the increase in the rebate pass throughs. Okay. So you add up the 15 plus the two plus the 3.5, that gets you $20.5 million on $200 million to spend. So that's like 10% less. Okay. But that's not the punchline of the story. You can hear stories about reference based pricing and, and changing the PBM to decrease spread pricing and to increase pathways, blah, blah, blah. You can hear about that all the time. Here's the point. The point is, is, is Marilyn Bartlett. The story here is her. She was 67. And the article says that she was not afraid of ruining her career. And she was not afraid of making people angry. And she was not afraid of making people angry. And so we've talked about on these videos before about the Pittsburgh school system. And we talked about John Tornis and Sarah Graham from the company that solved healthcare. And they all solved their healthcare cost problems in different ways than the state of Montana. However, what they all have in common is this. It's willpower. It's the will. And at the end of the day, most employee benefits managers and HR folks, you know, frankly, they are not, they're not going to, they are afraid of losing their career. And to a certain extent, they are afraid of making people angry. And that's normal. Like that's normal human behavior. Like I'm not judging them at all about that. Which is why John Tornis said, look, the CEO has to be the change agent. And so it really needs to start at the top because who at the end of the day is not quote unquote afraid of getting fired and who's not afraid of making people angry. It's really the CEO. And it's the boards of these companies. And so really, that's my message for today. The key is will. Does the company have the will to do it? Does it have the people within the organization that have the will to do it, that have the budget to do it, that have the power within the organization to do it? Because that's really one of the necessary ingredients. I mean, yes, you need all these ideas and the ideas are great, but the ideas themselves are not enough. You have to have the will. And that's my message for today. Thank you for watching me. Hope Cares E.

[0:00 - 0:04]  Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today we're
[0:04 - 0:12]  going to be discussing Will and Montana's Healthcare. So this is based on a story from
[0:12 - 0:19]  NPR and ProPublica from October of 2018 and I will leave a link in the show notes. And
[0:19 - 0:24]  this article is fantastic, so I thoroughly encourage you to read it. Okay, it's about
[0:24 - 0:30]  a woman named Marilyn Bartlett who used to be a controller for a Blue Cross Blue Shield
[0:30 - 0:34]  plan and then she became the CFO of a company that administers health plans. And she was
[0:34 - 0:41]  hired by the state of Montana's health plan which had 30,000 state employees and that
[0:41 - 0:48]  health plan, it was going broke. And she made a bunch of changes in anticipation of a July
[0:48 - 0:55]  1 of 2016 plan change and we're going to talk about what those specific changes were and
[0:55 - 1:01]  the results. Okay, what did she do? She went to the hospitals and she knew because she had
[1:01 - 1:05]  worked for a Blue Cross plan, she knew about the huge variance in the prices that they had.
[1:05 - 1:08]  So she went to them and she said, look we're going to do reference based pricing, we're
[1:08 - 1:12]  going to give you Medicare plus X percent and you're going to take it and you're going to
[1:12 - 1:16]  like it. And guess what they said? No, there was huge resistance. So she literally publicly
[1:16 - 1:22]  shamed them across the state until she finally got like every single hospital in the state
[1:22 - 1:31]  to agree to this. And what happened? That ended up saving the plan $15 million in 2018 and
[1:31 - 1:37]  even more in the back half of 2016 and 2017. Okay. Oh, by the way, the plan spends about
[1:37 - 1:44]  $200 million a year. Okay, great. Then she wasn't done there. She moved on to the PBM and she
[1:44 - 1:52]  knew about the, let's just call them secretive deals that PBMs have. And she said, okay, we
[1:52 - 1:57]  need a new PBM. So she got a new PBM that she eliminated the spread pricing because that
[1:57 - 2:03]  new PBM was wanting to do that and the old PBM was not. And she got a full rebate pass through.
[2:03 - 2:09]  So as a result of that, she was able to save $2 million per year from the no spread pricing
[2:09 - 2:16]  and $3.5 million a year from the increase in the rebate pass throughs. Okay. So you add
[2:16 - 2:22]  up the 15 plus the two plus the 3.5, that gets you $20.5 million on $200 million to spend.
[2:22 - 2:29]  So that's like 10% less. Okay. But that's not the punchline of the story. You can hear stories
[2:29 - 2:36]  about reference based pricing and, and changing the PBM to decrease spread pricing and to increase
[2:36 - 2:42]  pathways, blah, blah, blah. You can hear about that all the time. Here's the point. The point
[2:42 - 2:49]  is, is, is Marilyn Bartlett. The story here is her. She was 67. And the article says that
[2:49 - 2:56]  she was not afraid of ruining her career. And she was not afraid of making people angry. And
[2:56 - 3:00]  she was not afraid of making people angry. And so we've talked about on these videos before
[3:00 - 3:05]  about the Pittsburgh school system. And we talked about John Tornis and Sarah Graham from
[3:05 - 3:10]  the company that solved healthcare. And they all solved their healthcare cost problems in
[3:10 - 3:17]  different ways than the state of Montana. However, what they all have in common is this. It's
[3:17 - 3:25]  willpower. It's the will. And at the end of the day, most employee benefits managers and HR folks,
[3:25 - 3:29]  you know, frankly, they are not, they're not going to, they are afraid of losing their
[3:29 - 3:33]  career. And to a certain extent, they are afraid of making people angry. And that's normal.
[3:33 - 3:38]  Like that's normal human behavior. Like I'm not judging them at all about that. Which is
[3:38 - 3:44]  why John Tornis said, look, the CEO has to be the change agent. And so it really needs to
[3:44 - 3:49]  start at the top because who at the end of the day is not quote unquote afraid of getting
[3:49 - 3:57]  fired and who's not afraid of making people angry. It's really the CEO. And it's the boards of these
[3:57 - 4:03]  companies. And so really, that's my message for today. The key is will. Does the company have the
[4:03 - 4:08]  will to do it? Does it have the people within the organization that have the will to do it, that have
[4:08 - 4:15]  the budget to do it, that have the power within the organization to do it? Because that's really one of the
[4:15 - 4:20]  necessary ingredients. I mean, yes, you need all these ideas and the ideas are great, but the ideas
[4:20 - 4:25]  themselves are not enough. You have to have the will. And that's my message for today.
