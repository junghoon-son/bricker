  "text": " Hello this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is Marshall Allen's new book Never Pay the First Bill. Now I want to start off with a disclaimer here so where I am the chief medical officer now First Ob Health and actually the co-founder of First Ob Health Dr. Mark Friedman is mentioned in this book and I'm quoted in this book as well so just know upfront that I'm in this book so Marshall Allen is probably many of you know it's a very famous reporter from ProPublica the fantastic investigative journalism you know newspaper news site etc he's one of their longtime healthcare reporters he has a gazillion famous articles that have actually turned into like people in Congress like taking action so he has highly impactful journalism and he wrote this new book never pay the first bill and when it comes to billing one of the first things that Marshall Allen says in his book is that look when it comes to billing insurance companies and hospitals and other providers whether it be an imaging center or an ambulatory surgery center look they are bullies they are going to bully you and me around and if we are passive almost by definition we will be exploited so the expectation that I think Marshall Allen correctly paints here is that if you are passive and you just kind of go into healthcare system and just do as you're told and pay what you're told to pay you're going to be exploited so the only way to stop the bullying and to stop the exploitation is to push back and this book specifically says when and how and where and why to push back so if you're a healthcare consumer or if you're an employer that wants to educate your employees about how to push back against this bullying then this book is like the textbook on how to do that and I'm gonna give you a few very specific examples so he quotes Al Lewis who's the CEO of this company Quizify that does a whole bunch of healthcare and health insurance education and he Al Lewis recommends to have a to handwrite on the consent form at the hospital or the emergency room or the doctor's office because there's always a consent form that says that the healthcare provider is going to bill your insurance but that you the patient are ultimately responsible for the bill and what do you got to do you just it's all this little fine print and you just have to sign you don't know what you're signing sometimes you're in pain sometimes you're bleeding sometimes you can't breathe you don't know what you're signing but that's what you're signing you're signing something that says look they're gonna bill your insurance but if your insurance doesn't pay you the patient are responsible aha Al Lewis says how to fight back and I'm gonna grab the book itself because in the book Marshall Allen Al Lewis write specifically what you need and what I need to write on that consent when we sign it so we're supposed to write this in by hand and I'm gonna read it so I'm literally gonna put this on a little card in my wallet so I don't have to memorize it so that when I go in I can just write this down shoot I should have a little stamp I should just stamp it on there whenever I go in and it says I consent to appropriate treatment and including applicable insurance payments to be responsible for reasonable charges up to two times the Medicare rate and that's the key part right there at the end to be responsible for reasonable charges up to two times the Medicare rate in other words you hand right in there that you're willing to pay up to two times the Medicare rate and that gives you and then you sign it and that gives you in writing the ability to say hey look I can send it to two times the Medicare rate I did not consent to more than two times the Medicare rate and it has worked many many times according to Al Lewis it's a great suggestion next up as an individual you can totally sue the hospital healthcare provider the physician practice in small claims court for completely inappropriate bills and billing amounts so specifically here's how you do it step one you want to find the fair price for your service is it an MRI is it a CT scan is it a lab test is it a surgery he recommends going to fair health consumer org to find that fair price next you write a letter to the head of the billing department for the hospital physician practice what have you and the general counsel for the major hospital system because they often have one and you want to send it certified so that you have a paper trail and there are examples of these letters in the book and in fact there is a complete rubric where all you have to do is fill in the blanks so like the letters like already written written out for you and it's on page 228 it's incredibly helpful like I literally have an ER bill where I'm going to use this wording and this rubric to write a letter yeah it's not just for individuals it's also for employers as well and he describes he Marshall Allen describes a specific six-step process that employers can go through to essentially to be active and not be passive because he says again I think correctly so that if you're an employer and you're passive then by definition you are going to be exploited so the only way to not be exploited is to be an active participant in the purchasing of your health care and he outlines these six steps to do it yeah much of this is based upon the famous story of Marilyn Bartlett from the state of Montana's health plan and I've made two videos about Marilyn Bartlett and state of Montana and Marshall Allen has written extensively on Marilyn Bartlett as well there are fantastic videos about how Marilyn Bartlett slashed the health care expenses for the state employees for the state of Montana I mean it is amazing and so I will leave a link in the show notes to those things specifically that Marilyn Bartlett did some of which you as an employer can employ yourselves so Marshall Allen's book never pay the purse bill it's just recently out I highly recommend it that's what I wanted to share with you today and thank you for watching a health care see",
