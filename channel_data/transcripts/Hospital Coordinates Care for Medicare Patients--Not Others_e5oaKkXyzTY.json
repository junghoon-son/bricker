  "text": " Hello this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is multidisciplinary rounds and Medicare versus commercial insurance. Now I used to work as what's called a hospitalist so that's generally a general internal medicine physician that's what I am that works specifically just in the hospital. So there was an outpatient practice right across the street and there were outpatient physicians both in general internal medicine but also in cardiology and endocrinology and oncology and if their patients got admitted to the hospital then our group of hospitalists would take care of those patients just in the hospital and we did something called multidisciplinary rounds so this is where every Tuesday and Thursday we would sit down in a small conference room just down the hall from all the patients and we would discuss the patients with case management, social work, physical therapy, and nursing and there would be representatives from each one of those areas and the physicians would kind of rotate through and sit down and go through their list of patients to discuss okay well where was the person in terms of their hospital stay what else did they need in their hospital stay what was their goal in terms of getting discharged did they think it was going to be today or tomorrow or a week from now and then also what needed to be done as far as coordinating care after discharge whether they were going to a skilled nursing facility or to acute rehab or to an LTAC a long-term acute care facility or if they were going to home do they need home care and additional services at home so that was all coordinated through these various departments along with the physician it was great like I actually found it being incredibly helpful like constructive conversations because each of these groups thinks about patients in their own unique way like in a very helpful way and when you work together as a team to address all of the psychosocial issues of a patient in addition to their medical issues then arguably it's like better care because it incorporates like them as like a person as opposed to them as just like a set of lungs or just the stomach okay great guess what we only did multi-disciplinary rounds for Medicare patients why was that because of what's referred to as the Medicare prospective payment system which which was started way back in the 80s where Medicare would pay the hospital just based upon DRG so it was not based on the length of stay so if someone came in for a pneumonia or for a bloodstream infection the hospital got X amount of dollars whether they were there for two days or 20 days okay so in other words it financially motivated the hospital to actually have that hospital stay be short or as short as possible also there was no payment if the patient was readmitted within like 90 days so not only did the hospital want to shorten the length of stay but they didn't just want to boot them out and have a bounce back where the person got readmitted but they wanted to be discharged and stay out because if the person got readmitted the hospital wouldn't get paid anymore for that now if the person was out for let's say 90 days and then was readmitted for let's say a second pneumonia then they would get additional payment but there was financial motive for these multidisciplinary rounds guess who we did not do multidisciplinary rounds for we did not do them for commercial insurance patients so if you had one of the major insurance networks or you were employed and had your insurance through a company guess what you were almost treated like a second-class citizen like the case managers would say oh no this person's got private insurance like Dr. Brigger you let them stay as long as you want okay we also didn't do as much coordination around like their discharge planning and all sit down around a table to figure it out because like if they were readmitted then the insurance company would just pay the hospital again okay so what's my point my point is the reimbursement drives care practices reimbursement drives care practices the hospital where i work actually won an award for high quality care high quality care for who was it for the medicare patients was it for the commercial insurance patients like i don't even know but the point is is that we treated populations of patients very differently because we were paid very differently by those uh by the payers for those patients so just know that the money say okay well maybe we should have been doing multidisciplinary rounds for the commercially insured folks as well i would argue that the insurance companies wish they could get the same deal that medicare got i bet you the insurance companies wish that they could get uh uh reimbursement to the hospital regardless of length of stay and would not want to pay them if they got readmitted within 90 days i bet you the commercial insurance companies wanted that plan but guess what they couldn't get medicare could and as a result the medicare patients got extra meetings and extra coordination that the commercial insurance patients didn't get and that's my point for today thank you for for watching adolph care z",
