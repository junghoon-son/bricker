  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker, and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is hospital cost cutting in coronavirus, and it's specifically going to be about staff, because that's really how hospitals cut costs. Now, as has been previously reported in A Healthcare Z, and I'll leave a link in the show notes to prior videos, and also just all over the news, there are huge decreases in patient volume and revenue for hospitals. So large hospital revenue is down about $1.4 billion a day in aggregate across the country. And just in Texas alone, patient volume is down 56% because of people staying away from the hospital, because of many elective, non-urgent procedures being canceled or delayed, etc. So in response to that, hospitals are needing to cut costs, and cutting costs for hospitals means decreasing staff. Because hospitals are, it's a service business, but the vast majority of what a hospital does is service, and services are delivered by people. And therefore, the cost of a hospital system is really in the form of wages and benefits for those people. It's the labor cost. It makes up 55% of the total costs for hospitals. Total expenditure for the hospitals is in labor. And this is according to the Hospital Financial Management Association, which is the trade association for hospital CFOs and financial folks. And these are the folks that know, okay? So, it's wages and benefits. Okay, everything else pales in comparison. Like medicine, like medicine, supplies, equipment, like the physical plant just to keep the place open, like compliance, etc. Like not even close. It is in the wages and benefits. It's where all the money is in the hospital. So if they need to decrease their costs, unfortunately, they have to decrease their employees. Okay, this is being done through layoffs, furloughs, and pay cuts. Okay, now there are a lot of people that work at a hospital. So, for very large hospitals, like university, medical school, academic medical centers, big inner city hospitals, etc. So hospitals that have greater than 500 beds, and a really big hospital is like 750 beds, or even like super huge. They might even be approaching like 900 beds. That hospital alone has, on average, has 4,900 employees in it. It's huge! Okay, and your typical community hospital is like 250 beds. So for hospitals that have 200 and 299 beds, they have 1,100 employees at a community hospital. Like in this day and age, like where are there even places of work where you have 1,100 people working in the same place? Like they almost don't exist, like maybe in like education at a university, but like we don't have huge factories here in America that much anymore, right? So like hospitals are huge concentrations of employees in one place. Now, it is patient care staff that we're going to talk about today. So we're not going to talk about the administrative staff at all. What does that make up? It's the nurses, but it's also a ton of support staff. So clinical support staff, oftentimes referred to as techs. So there's like medical techs that are up on the floor helping out the nurses. So underneath the supervision of the nurses, and they check blood pressure, and they check glucose, and they help do a myriad number of things on the floor. There's operating room techs. There's radiology techs. There's procedure techs for like endoscopies, like colonoscopies and upper endoscopies, and in the cardiac cath lab. There's the transport folks that move people around from room to room and to the various tests and procedures they need to go to. There's the facilities folks. There's dining. There's PT and OT. There's social work. Now, there are some doctors that are on staff at the hospital, and they're typically the hospitalists. Okay, so that's actually what I used to be at the hospital. So they are an internist oftentimes at the hospital that is employed by the hospital. So all these people are getting laid off, furloughed, and having pay cuts. Now, what I've drawn here is, look at this, my attempt at drawing a hospital. So many hospitals are set up this way. Obviously, it's not universal. But on the first floor, you can see here the little ambulance. Typically, they'll have the emergency room. Typically, they'll have the lab. And typically, they'll have radiology right there as well on the first floor. Now, on the second floor, oftentimes they have the operating rooms, the cath lab, many of the other procedure rooms as well, again, for the endoscopies. Now, I did medical school in Chicago. And I can tell you, at Cook County Hospital, the operating rooms, instead of being on the second floor, they were on the top floor. This is at the old Cook County Hospital. And believe it or not, when it rained, the operating rooms would leak. Okay? So not all hospitals are arranged this way, but this is just like an example. And then, oftentimes, on the third floor, you might have like the ICU. Sometimes the ICU is on the top floor. And then you'll have all the different patient floor or wards. You have the medical floors and the surgical floors. Now, hospitals oftentimes have wings as well or individual units on each of those floors. So oftentimes, they're divided like east-west and north-south. So you have like four west and four east, et cetera. So I actually worked as a hospitalist during the Great Recession, 2008, 2009, 2010. And patient volumes dramatically decreased at that time as well because of increased rates of unemployment. Now, not nearly as much as now. Now, however, what the hospitals would do is they would shut down individual floors and wards. So the hospital where I work actually shut down an entire floor and then an entire wing of floors as well. The third floor and they might shut down like four west. Okay. So that's typically what they do. What does that mean? That means that those nurses, those patient technicians, the sort of proportionate number of transporters, et cetera, et cetera, they would subsequently be laid off or furloughed. Likewise, in the operating rooms, when I was in medical school in Chicago, there were hospitals that were really struggling because they did not have nearly the number of patients they used to have. And they would just shut down entire operating rooms. So all the OR might have like 12 operating rooms. And only six of those ORs would be open. The other ones, the doors were locked and the lights were off. So just know that sort of modular approach to sort of piecemeal shutting those things down. That's what they've done in the past. It's highly likely that's what they'll do in the future. Now, in the past, after the economy came back, guess what they did? They reopened the floors. They reopened the wings. They reopened the ORs if the patient volume came back. So will that take six months, six years to happen? I don't know. But I wanted to go through the numbers in terms of the large amount of labor that is at a hospital and how that might take shape. And thank you for watching A Healthcare Z.",
