  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today we're going to be discussing all or nothing hospital contracts. So, it has been reported in the news site Axios and in other places as well that when insurance carriers contract with major hospital systems, that major hospital system says, look, you have to take all of our doctors as in-network or none of them. So it's all or nothing. Why is that important? We talked in a previous video about how physician skill falls along a bell-shaped curve just like it does for anybody else in any other profession or even like playing sports, right? And so here you have the number of physicians on the y-axis and the number of the amount of skill on the x-axis and it follows a bell-shaped curve, right? So you have the low-skilled physicians down here and the high-skilled physicians up here. And I think if you talk to most physicians, they would agree to a certain extent there's a bell-shaped curve. Okay, how does that matter to employer health plans? So Walmart, the largest private employer in America, wanted to get rid of these guys. They wanted the bottom five percent of the physicians out of their carrier networks. They wanted them out. And guess what happened? The carriers said no. They said that their contracts forbid this from happening. So as every other employer in America that is smaller than Walmart, how in the world are they supposed to go to their carrier and ask for them to create like client-specific networks, take certain doctors out of the networks when Walmart can't even do it? Okay, now I want to contrast that with a different story. And that is the story of the Allegheny County school system. And where is Allegheny County, Pennsylvania? It's Pittsburgh. So it's the Pittsburgh public school system. Okay, what did they do? They identified, they did the opposite. Instead of wanting to take the bottom five percent out, they identified the top providers in their area associated with one particular hospital system. Okay, they said, look, these folks have the highest skill. Therefore, we are going to create a plan where for seeing that particular, those particular providers, there is no deductible and the plan pays at 100%. For the other in-network physicians, there was a deductible and then the plan paid 80% and then there was your typical out-of-network benefits. Okay, great. So in other words, there were three tiers, but instead of getting rid of the bottom five percent, they instead incentivized through plan design going to the top physicians. Okay, great. What happened? Here's the punchline. Their cost went from $241 million down to $233 million, a decrease of $8 million. Now, yeah, it's only like two or three percent, but the point is, is that it didn't go to trend. It didn't stay flat. It actually went down. And so I think this drives home a couple of points. One is, is that it's probably not likely that the carrier's contracts are going to allow for this type of steerage. So just know that when you get into the weeds of the contracts, it might not be possible because within a particular health system, there are going to be good doctors and not so good doctors. And so you're not going to want a whole health system amass. What you're going to want to do is you're going to really want those best providers that are in there. So that's number one. Number two is Allegheny County is similar to John Tornis and the company that solved healthcare with Seragraph in that look. All of their employees were concentrated in one place, which to a certain extent makes it easier to identify these high, let's call them five percenters in their particular area. So if you're an employer that has a more distributed employee population, which frankly, at the end of the day, unless you're like a municipality or school system, frankly, your employees are probably going to be spread out more across the country. It's going to make it more challenging to identify those top physicians. Now, again, I will tell you that the company where I used to work, Compass, actually does this, but I'll just leave it at that and say that, look, the bottom line is, is that when you are working to decrease health plan costs, higher quality is almost invariably lower cost. Higher skilled physicians is almost invariably lower cost. And there are things that you can do at the employer level, at the brokerage level, at the benefit consultant level to affect change in regards to that. And thank you for watching A Healthcare Z.",
