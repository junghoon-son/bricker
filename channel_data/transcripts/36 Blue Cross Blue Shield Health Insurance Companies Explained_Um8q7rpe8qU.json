  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Health Care Z. Today we're going to be discussing Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations. Now if we're going to talk about healthcare in America, we have to understand Blue Cross Blue Shield because according to their own website, they touch like a third of Americans. So Blue Cross is a huge deal. Okay. Now why do I say organizations? Because there are 36 individual companies that are part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield. So Blue Shield Association. So the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is an actual thing. It only has like a thousand employees. It's based in Chicago. They basically like provide licenses or grant the license to be a Blue Cross member organization. But then each of these 36 individual organizations are like their own legal entities. Okay. Now they all share a network. Meaning that if you have a Blue Cross employee that is in one part of the country versus another part of the country, like they like share each other's network. So it's all part of the network. So it's all part of the quote unquote Blue Cross provider network. But in terms of each individual plan, they're different. Okay. So that's one thing that makes Blue Cross unique. Another thing that makes Blue Cross unique is that for the vast majority of these 36 individual Blue Cross plans, they do not compete with each other. They have specific geographic boundaries where the companies that are domiciled within their geography, other Blue Cross plans, and other blue cross plans, and other blue cross plans cannot. Now there are some small exceptions to that, which I'm going to go over. However, let's get started with the A number one biggest one, which is Anthem. Okay. Now Anthem is also unique in that it is a for-profit company. It is number 33 on the Fortune 500. It's publicly traded. You could buy stock in Anthem. Blue Cross Blue Cross plan. Now it has, it's like the major like Anthem Blue Cross plan in California. It's not even called Anthem in New York state. It's called Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. Also it's called Blue Cross, it owns Blue Cross Blue Shield in Georgia. Now Anthem also sells plans in like Connecticut and Colorado. So it's in a number of states as well. So it is by far the 800 pound gorilla. Now next up is HCSC or Healthcare Services Corporation. Now of course, no one's ever heard of Healthcare Services Corporation because it goes by its individual constituencies. Oh by the way, it's non-profit so you can't buy stock in it. It's not publicly traded. It's a non-profit organization. Okay. It's Blue Cross in Illinois, Blue Cross in Texas, Blue Cross in Oklahoma, Blue Cross in New Mexico, and Blue Cross in Montana. Okay. Now all of these Blue Cross plans are part of the same organization, HCSC, so the same corporate entity, even though in Texas where we are, you have by the same organization. Blue Cross in Texas, and if you're in Chicago, you have by Blue Cross in Illinois. Okay. Are you confused enough yet? Is your head spinning yet? We move on. Okay. Then there is Highmark, which is the Blue Cross plan for part of Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West Virginia. Now Pennsylvania is very unique in that, guess what? It doesn't have one, not two, but it has three different Blue Cross plans. Capital Blue Cross is in like the Harrisburg area, but there are parts of the state of Pennsylvania where Highmark and Capital and Independence actually compete with each other. So you can have competing Blue Cross plans. Now Pennsylvania is highly unique in that respect, so I'm not going to belabor the point. But again, it's complicated. Next up, Care First Blue Cross is for the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Northern Virginia. Next up is Primera Blue Cross, which is for the state of Washington and Alaska. Next up is Cambia, but it's not really known in the market as Cambia. It's known by Regents Blue Cross, which is for the District of Columbia, and it's known by Regents Blue Cross, which is for the District of Columbia, and it's known by Regents Blue Cross of Oregon, or Idaho, or Utah, or again in Washington. So there we have another overlap between Primera and Regents. Okay, next up is Wellmark. Not to be confused with Highmark, but Wellmark Blue Cross is in Iowa and South Dakota. Okay, now you have all the individual state Blue Cross plans as well for like the remainder of the states. And so it's just some highlighted names there like Blue Cross of Alabama, Blue Cross of Tennessee, and then there's like Blue Cross of Kansas City. So there's a Blue Cross of Missouri, there's a Blue Cross of Kansas, but then there's a separate Blue Cross of Kansas City, which only does the metro Kansas City area on both the Kansas side and the Missouri side. And again, if you're a company that's domiciled in the Kansas City area, you go through Blue Cross of Kansas City, whereas if you're like in central Missouri, you go through Blue Cross of Missouri. Again, are you confused yet? It's a little complicated. Okay, then finally we've got Blue Cross of South Carolina. Why do I bring up Blue Cross of South Carolina? Okay, they offer the Blue Cross plan in their state, but they also have a subsidiary that is called National Alliance. And National Alliance actually acts as the back office for 11 out of the 36 Blue Cross plans, and they tend to be these smaller Blue Cross plans. What does back office mean? That means they do the claims processing, they do customer service. So you think you have a Blue Cross plan of XYZ State, but when you call into customer service, they might answer the phone, Blue Cross of XYZ State, but they're actually a Blue Cross of South Carolina National Alliance employee. Oh, by the way, they do case management, they do disease management. So essentially that Blue Cross plan that outsources its back office to National Alliance, they're essentially just a sales and marketing and customer client success organization, because everything else is done through National Alliance. So Blue Cross Blue Shield is incredibly complex, but I wanted to share that with you today. Thank you for watching ALCAREZ.",
