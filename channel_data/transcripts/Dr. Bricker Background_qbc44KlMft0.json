  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker with A Healthcare Z and today I want to briefly talk about my background and why I may be qualified to talk with you, the Employee Benefits community, about health care. So as I mentioned in my intro I'm a general internist and before I went into medical school I actually used to be a hospital finance consultant where I used to work in the billing and business office of major medical centers helping them bill and collect reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance carriers. That was a wonderful claims experience. It was back in the 90s when everyone thought that managed care was going to ruin medicine and every single doctor that I talked to said whatever you do don't go into medicine because of all the bureaucracy and the government and health insurance companies have just ruined it. Well I wanted to go in eyes wide open and see for myself what all that bureaucracy was about. So I had this wonderful experience with ICD-9 coding and the CPT codes and all sorts of wonderful stuff and so went on to medical school and residency and just loved seeing patients and loved bedside medicine and wanted to take what I knew from my hospital finance days and combine that with what I knew from patient care and seeing patients and bring that to employee benefits professionals because you have so much influence over employees and their families what I used to call patients and so I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to speak with you today and with that I will end the session. Thanks so much. Bye now.",
