 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is what women want, the key to employee health. That's right. I'm about to do the most presumptuous thing humanly possible. I, as a man, I'm about to tell you what women want according to their health. Now, this is important because on a previous A Healthcare Z video, I stated that, listen, women make 80% of the healthcare decisions for a family. They're essentially the health CEO of the family. So if we want to improve the health of the men and the children and the women themselves, then you got to focus on the women. They're the top. They're the head honcho when it comes to health in the family. Okay. So there was a Gallup poll rather recently in April of 2024, specifically asking over 4,000 women about their health and their priorities. And this is what the Gallup poll found. It found that the top priorities for a woman's health is number one, mental and emotional health. Two, sleep. Three, weight. Four, nutrition. And five, chronic disease. So like diseases like asthma and diabetes, like that's a distant number five. It's mental health, sleep, weight, and nutrition. Those are the main health priorities for women. Now, the same survey said, look, 70% of women said, it's hard to prioritize these things, right? It's super hard. The only reason I'm laughing is because in my own personal experience, I found that totally to be true in terms of my own family, in terms of the women that I work with, in terms of the other women that I know. Oh, it's totally hard, right? So the question is why? Why is it hard? And what's interesting is that the Gallup poll, they broke it down a number of ways. But one of the ways they broke it down was between women who have kids at home under the age of 18. In other words, moms who are actively raising children and women who do not have kids under the age of 18 at home, either because they're not moms or because all their kids are grown and either independent or they're just out of the house. So they're not actively involved in raising children. And there was a pretty big difference between those two cohorts of women. So women who are essentially actively raising children, like 85% said that, look, caring for other people was a huge barrier for their health because they were putting the health of other people first, namely their children. But it could have also been their spouse. It could have been their adult parents, et cetera. Okay, next. Notice for women, it was much that did not have any, that were not actively involved in raising children. It was much lower. It was only 42%. Okay. Now time, huge, time, huge barrier, not enough time, huge barrier to health. Okay. For women that were actively raising children, time was a huge problem for two thirds of them. And for women who were not actively raising children, it was only 48%. It was less than half. So pretty big difference there. Okay. Next up money. Okay. So financial barriers to care were a problem for 55% of women who were actively raising children. And it was a problem for a smaller number for women who are not actively raising children. It was only 44%. Of course, one of the big reasons why, shoot, kids are expensive. Anybody with kids knows they're expensive. So money's going to be like a bigger issue when you're dealing with people that are raising kids, women that are raising kids. Okay. Now, so then now, okay, so fine. So if like actively raising kids is like a big issue in terms of a woman's being able to take care of her own health, let's then break down what age women are when they have kids. So you're looking at your employee population and it's like, okay, we've got women of all sorts of ages here working at this place on our employee health plan. Which of these women have kids? Well, you can, to a certain extent, their age tells you, right? Okay. So women 20 to 24, 15% of them have kids. Women between the ages of 25 and 29, 40% of them have kids. Women between the ages of 30 and 34, 62% of them have kids. Right. It keeps going up because, you know, as these women age, right, they're having kids, et cetera. Okay. Now women 35 to 39, 78% of them have kids. And then women age 40 and over 85% of them have kids, right? So you essentially have sort of two groups, right? All the people above the line, all the women above the line. So like if your company just theoretically had nothing but 20 to 24 year old women, then 15% of those women would have kids. And 85% of those women would not have kids. So this is, this side of the line is like all the women that don't have kids. And then this side of the line down here is all the women that do have kids. Now, of course, this line starts to curve down once because about 15% of women don't ever have kids, but then it starts curving down because the women that had kids earlier on, well, those kids age and they're no longer under the age of 18. They're a lot more independent. Okay. So the average age for a woman having their first child is 27. And then the average age of a woman having their last child is 31. So by the time they're 49, 31 plus 18 is 49. That means that you start getting women that when their last child is starting to be 18 and, you know, more independent, maybe out of the house, maybe not, et cetera. Okay. So what does this tell us then? What are the implications for an employer sponsored health plan? What are the implications for? Okay. Well, knowing this about how, listen, listen, women are the head honcho. Women have certain priorities. Women have a hard time meeting those health priorities. And one of the biggest impacts in terms of meeting those health priorities is whether or not the woman has kids. Okay. Now, one, the offer to women should not be, hey, let us help you with your chronic diseases. You got diabetes. Let me help you with your diabetes. You've got hypertension. Let us help you with your hypertension. Shoot. That's number five. Okay. So engagement with employee engagement, specifically engagement with women around their health is you can't do anything unless you get engagement, unless you can actually get them to talk to the healthcare provider, doctor, nurse practitioner, et cetera. You got to get them to talk to them. What, what's the offer? What do you want them to talk about? Let's talk about their mental health. Let's talk about their sleep. Let's talk about their weight. Let's talk about their nutrition. That's what the most number of women are concerned about with their health. And it's only 35%. Oh, by the way, it's over half for mental health. It's like in the forties, um, for sleep, weight, and nutrition. And then for chronic disease, it's only like 35% of women are, uh, even place chronic disease as a priority. So don't be like, we can help you with your diabetes or your hypertension, because only 35% of women are going to care about that. You're going to focus on the big four, mental health, sleep, weight, and nutrition. Okay. So that's what the offer needs to be around. You want to cast a wide net. Now they might have underlying metabolic dysfunction. They have a whole bunch of preventative services. You maybe screen them for, um, for, you know, high cholesterol, hypertension, etc. So you'll be able to find these underlying oftentimes silent conditions, but you don't use that as the offer to initially engage them in their health. Instead, you make your priority as a clinician and as an employer, you make your priority, their priorities. And these are their priorities. Okay. Next up, you want to address the barriers for going in and getting care. What are those barriers? Well, you, you got to do a mix of both in-person and virtual visits, right? Because they're busy taking care of kids. They don't have time. So you want to offer also same day and next day appointments, again, either in-person or virtual again, because they're caring for kids, they don't have time. So you really have to address those just logistical issues of ensuring access to the care and then also making it at zero out of pocket costs to address the money. Right? And so this is where the onsite, near-site clinics, general primary care, this is where they knock, uh, traditional primary care out of the water because they offer same day, next day visits. They offer zero out of pocket costs. Shoot. You can even have the kid and the, because of course the majority of pediatric visits, it's the mom who takes the child. You can address the mom's health issues and the child's issues during the same visit, if it makes sense. Okay. Next. And lastly, you are going to use the woman head honcho of the health family to help the men because believe, because men never go to the doctor. There was a survey from the University of California, Irvine that found that 60% of men will not go to the doctor, even if they think they have a major health problem. So even if they think something bad is going on with them, over half of them still won't go. And so it's super important. And I see, I've seen this in my own, um, patient visits where it's like, look, if you can work with the wife or significant other on the man, then that's super helpful to get him in. And so the key to the health of the family is through the women. And here are some ways to engage them that might be helpful. And I wanted to share that with you today. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z.

[0:00 - 0:06]  Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is
[0:06 - 0:14]  what women want, the key to employee health. That's right. I'm about to do the most presumptuous
[0:14 - 0:21]  thing humanly possible. I, as a man, I'm about to tell you what women want according to their
[0:21 - 0:26]  health. Now, this is important because on a previous A Healthcare Z video, I stated that,
[0:26 - 0:34]  listen, women make 80% of the healthcare decisions for a family. They're essentially the health CEO
[0:34 - 0:40]  of the family. So if we want to improve the health of the men and the children and the women themselves,
[0:41 - 0:46]  then you got to focus on the women. They're the top. They're the head honcho when it comes to health
[0:46 - 0:52]  in the family. Okay. So there was a Gallup poll rather recently in April of 2024, specifically
[0:52 - 0:58]  asking over 4,000 women about their health and their priorities. And this is what the Gallup poll
[0:58 - 1:07]  found. It found that the top priorities for a woman's health is number one, mental and emotional
[1:07 - 1:20]  health. Two, sleep. Three, weight. Four, nutrition. And five, chronic disease. So like diseases like
[1:20 - 1:28]  asthma and diabetes, like that's a distant number five. It's mental health, sleep, weight, and nutrition.
[1:28 - 1:38]  Those are the main health priorities for women. Now, the same survey said, look, 70% of women said,
[1:38 - 1:43]  it's hard to prioritize these things, right? It's super hard. The only reason I'm laughing is because
[1:43 - 1:49]  in my own personal experience, I found that totally to be true in terms of my own family,
[1:49 - 1:54]  in terms of the women that I work with, in terms of the other women that I know. Oh, it's totally hard,
[1:54 - 2:00]  right? So the question is why? Why is it hard? And what's interesting is that the Gallup poll,
[2:01 - 2:04]  they broke it down a number of ways. But one of the ways they broke it down was between
[2:04 - 2:11]  women who have kids at home under the age of 18. In other words, moms who are actively raising

[2:49 - 2:53]  it was much that did not have any, that were not actively involved in raising children. It was much
[2:53 - 2:59]  lower. It was only 42%. Okay. Now time, huge, time, huge barrier, not enough time, huge barrier to
[2:59 - 3:04]  health. Okay. For women that were actively raising children, time was a huge problem for two thirds of
[3:04 - 3:10]  them. And for women who were not actively raising children, it was only 48%. It was less than half.
[3:10 - 3:18]  So pretty big difference there. Okay. Next up money. Okay. So financial barriers to care were a problem for 55%
[3:18 - 3:24]  of women who were actively raising children. And it was a problem for a smaller number for women who
[3:24 - 3:29]  are not actively raising children. It was only 44%. Of course, one of the big reasons why, shoot,
[3:29 - 3:33]  kids are expensive. Anybody with kids knows they're expensive. So money's going to be like a bigger
[3:33 - 3:38]  issue when you're dealing with people that are raising kids, women that are raising kids. Okay.
[3:38 - 3:45]  Now, so then now, okay, so fine. So if like actively raising kids is like a big issue in terms of a
[3:45 - 3:54]  woman's being able to take care of her own health, let's then break down what age women are when they
[3:54 - 3:59]  have kids. So you're looking at your employee population and it's like, okay, we've got women
[3:59 - 4:04]  of all sorts of ages here working at this place on our employee health plan. Which of these women have
[4:04 - 4:13]  kids? Well, you can, to a certain extent, their age tells you, right? Okay. So women 20 to 24,
[4:13 - 4:22]  15% of them have kids. Women between the ages of 25 and 29, 40% of them have kids. Women between the
[4:22 - 4:29]  ages of 30 and 34, 62% of them have kids. Right. It keeps going up because, you know, as these women
[4:29 - 4:38]  age, right, they're having kids, et cetera. Okay. Now women 35 to 39, 78% of them have kids. And then women

[4:51 - 4:56]  theoretically had nothing but 20 to 24 year old women, then 15% of those women would have kids.
[4:56 - 5:01]  And 85% of those women would not have kids. So this is, this side of the line is like all the women that
[5:01 - 5:05]  don't have kids. And then this side of the line down here is all the women that do have kids. Now,

[5:18 - 5:23]  they're no longer under the age of 18. They're a lot more independent. Okay. So the average age for a
[5:23 - 5:30]  woman having their first child is 27. And then the average age of a woman having their last child
[5:30 - 5:38]  is 31. So by the time they're 49, 31 plus 18 is 49. That means that you start getting women that
[5:39 - 5:45]  when their last child is starting to be 18 and, you know, more independent, maybe out of the house,
[5:45 - 5:51]  maybe not, et cetera. Okay. So what does this tell us then? What are the implications for
[5:51 - 5:57]  an employer sponsored health plan? What are the implications for? Okay. Well, knowing this
[5:57 - 6:04]  about how, listen, listen, women are the head honcho. Women have certain priorities. Women have a hard
