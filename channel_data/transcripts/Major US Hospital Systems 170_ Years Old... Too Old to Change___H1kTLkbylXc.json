  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is, are healthcare organizations too old? Now, it's important for us to put in context what we mean by old. So there's a fantastic article actually from CNBC that showed that the average age of an S&P 500 company is only 20 years. So most of the largest corporations in America on average are not that old, 20 years. Now, they compare that to in 1950, the average age of a corporation in the S&P 500 was 60 years. So in other words, companies in America have gotten a lot younger. And the reason for that is because of disruption, because of new organizations. These new organizations that have done things a different way with new technologies and with new cultures and with new people. They're the ones that have grown to create the products and the services that we have today. And of course, you could talk about Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, yada, yada, yada. You can go on and on about that. Next, hospital systems, on the other hand, are old. Now, I'm not going to go through every single hospital system in America, but I'm going to go through some of the very large non-profit ones. Okay, Ascension, it says that it was founded in 1999, but it was actually the combination of the Daughters of Charity and St. Joseph's. So two large organizations of Catholic nuns. And these organizations were phenomenal. They started in the 1800s. I mean, you should go online and read the histories of these sisters. I mean, it is truly awe-inspiring. I mean, I was kind of in a bad mood today, but after reading these stories, it was like a total white pick-me-up. It was so inspiring. They have done so much for so many people. And they've been doing it for a really long time. Next up, we have Common Spirit, which is a very new healthcare system. In fact, as new as 2019, because it was the merger of Catholic health initiatives, which, oh, by the way, said that it was founded in 1996. But it was started by 13 different groups of nuns. Again, most of whom were from the mid-1800s, like around 1850. Again, if you look at them, they actually have some black and white photos of these nuns and what they did. Again, it was amazing. Okay. And also, Dignity, which was the Sisters of Mercy back in the 1800s. Okay. Again, these organizations aren't like twice as old as the SBA. They're not even 60 years old. We're talking like 170-year-old organizations. Okay. This whole truth for the Trinity healthcare system as well, started by nuns in the 1800s. This whole truth for Providence St. Josephs, started by nuns in the 1800s and the early 1900s. So, now, they might have brand new hospital buildings. They might have brand new ambulatory surgery centers. They might have a lot of new physical facilities. But the organizations themselves are very old. Even if they're given, like, new names and new, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The organizations themselves are very old. And anyone who has been a part of an organization knows that the older that organization gets, the harder it is for that organization to change. So, if healthcare in America is going to change, then the organizations in healthcare in America need to change. And to a certain extent, I'm not sure if these organizations are young enough to change. Maybe they're just too old. And really, as a sort of a practical yardstick, is that really creative destruction is typically seen as a sign of progress, right? I mean, like, Woolworths doesn't exist anymore. Like, Pan American Airlines doesn't exist anymore. So, either these organizations are going to have to go through some sort of dramatic change. I don't know how it's going to happen. I'm not saying it's not possible. Anything's possible. Or, there just needs to be something new. And that's my point for today. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z.",
