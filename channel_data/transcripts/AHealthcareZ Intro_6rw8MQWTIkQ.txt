 Hello, my name is Dr. Eric Bricker and this is A Healthcare Z. I am a general internist. I went to medical school at the University of Illinois at Chicago and did my residency training at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. And A Healthcare Z is a video blog for insurance brokers, benefit consultants, and HR professionals. And it's really a continuation of my blog that I used to do at Compass. And it's in video form because I thought that would be a better way to educate all of you about healthcare and its nuances. So thank you so much for joining.
