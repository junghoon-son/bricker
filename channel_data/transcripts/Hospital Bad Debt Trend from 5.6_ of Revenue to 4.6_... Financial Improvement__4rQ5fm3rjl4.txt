 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is Hospital Bad Debt Trends. So, bad debt is the uncollected bills that are subsequently written off by the hospital. And the key word here is uncollected. So in other words, the hospital expected to get paid. They wanted to get paid and they did not get paid. Okay, well where does this bad debt come from? It comes from the uninsured patients. So they'll provide care whether it's in the emergency room or the inpatient setting or even sometimes the outpatient setting and they'll bill the patient and like either they don't have insurance or they don't have an ability to pay. So there's no collection. Okay, then the second category is for people that do have insurance but it's the out-of-pocket costs associated with their health insurance plan. In other words, it's the deductible or it's the coinsurance where they'll get some money from the insurance carrier but then the remaining patient balance of the deductible of $500, $1,000, $2,000 is not collected by the patient. The patient doesn't pay it and so they write it off to bad debt. Okay, so that's what bad debt is. Now, in 2014, bad debt was 5.6% of net patient revenue. And I underline net patient revenue here because that is not billed charges. So net patient revenue is the amount that's actually collected by medic, you know, from Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, and for people that actually do pay, self-pay. Okay, so it's not the billed charges. It's not the amount that's billed out. It is of the total that they collected in or were expected to collect in, they had to write off 5.6% of that. Okay, how has that changed over time? Okay, in 2015, it went down by to 4.7. It went to a low of 4.3. And now it's up a little bit to 4.6 in 2018, which is the most recent year we have the statistics for that. Okay, so it's down an entire percentage point from 5.6 down to 4.6. Okay, why did that happen? It happened because of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, right? Medicaid expansion because the vast majority of that improvement in uncollected bills was in the fact that you had people that were uninsured before and not able to pay before, and now you had the state and the federal government in the form of Medicaid now paying for it. Okay, now keep in mind, this is on an overall growing pie of net patient revenue. Okay, so it's a small, not only did they have to write off less, but the pie grew. Okay, so in 2014, total net patient revenue for hospitals nationwide was about $900 billion, and in 2018, it increased to $1.1 trillion. So it went up by $200 billion. Okay, so not only is the pie of total revenue growing, but the slice of the pie that they had to write off was shrinking. So if you're a hospital, that's fantastic news. Okay, now let's put this into more specific numbers. So for the top 50 largest hospitals by net patient revenue, they earned $123 billion. Now, so an extra percentage point that they don't have to write off from the 5.6% to the 4.6%, that's an extra $1.23 billion that those 50 hospitals had. Okay, now keep in mind, this has nothing to do with charity care. This is totally separate from charity care. This is not charity care at all. This is stuff where the hospital is trying to get paid, and they didn't get paid. Not stuff that they're forgiving, because none of this is forgiven in any way. Okay, so specifically, let's look at some of the largest hospitals by net patient revenue. So New York Presbyterian, that extra one percentage point of lower write-offs for bad debt would result in an extra $153 million in 2018. For the Cleveland Clinic, that one percentage point decrease in bad debt write-offs would equal an extra $49 million. For the Stanford Hospital and healthcare system out on the West Coast, it would equal an additional $41 million. That's just in one year. If you applied that one percentage point improvement in bad debt to their net patient revenue for 2018, that's what they would get in that one year extra. It's like a Christmas present or a birthday present. Now, what could they do with that? They could give their employees raises. They could build a new capital campaign. They could switch over and provide more charity care with this money. They could create a free clinic. Shoot, with $53 million, you could probably create a whole bunch of free clinics for patients. So what's my point for today? My point for today is that, look, hospitals cannot cry poor. That's my point for today. Hospitals cannot cry poor, right? So sometimes you'll hear hospitals cry poor and say, well, with all these high deductible health plans, we can't collect the out-of-pocket costs from these high deductibles. And just, you know, and I see all these newspaper articles about like lawsuits against people going after their money. Just know that like that increased out-of-pocket financial responsibility is not hurting the hospitals. It's not. So from a financial standpoint, like on average, in general, hospitals are doing great. Now, obviously, you've seen stories about rural hospitals not doing well. But the point is, is that there are many, many, many hospitals that financially are doing great. And I wanted to share that with you today. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z.

[0:01 - 0:05]  Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic
[0:05 - 0:14]  is Hospital Bad Debt Trends. So, bad debt is the uncollected bills that are subsequently
[0:14 - 0:20]  written off by the hospital. And the key word here is uncollected. So in other words, the
[0:20 - 0:26]  hospital expected to get paid. They wanted to get paid and they did not get paid. Okay,
[0:26 - 0:31]  well where does this bad debt come from? It comes from the uninsured patients. So they'll
[0:31 - 0:35]  provide care whether it's in the emergency room or the inpatient setting or even sometimes
[0:35 - 0:40]  the outpatient setting and they'll bill the patient and like either they don't have insurance
[0:40 - 0:45]  or they don't have an ability to pay. So there's no collection. Okay, then the second category
[0:45 - 0:49]  is for people that do have insurance but it's the out-of-pocket costs associated with their
[0:49 - 0:52]  health insurance plan. In other words, it's the deductible or it's the coinsurance where
[0:52 - 0:56]  they'll get some money from the insurance carrier but then the remaining patient balance of the
[0:56 - 1:02]  deductible of $500, $1,000, $2,000 is not collected by the patient. The patient doesn't pay it
[1:02 - 1:08]  and so they write it off to bad debt. Okay, so that's what bad debt is. Now, in 2014, bad
[1:08 - 1:14]  debt was 5.6% of net patient revenue. And I underline net patient revenue here because that
[1:14 - 1:19]  is not billed charges. So net patient revenue is the amount that's actually collected by medic,
[1:19 - 1:25]  you know, from Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, and for people that actually do pay,
[1:26 - 1:30]  self-pay. Okay, so it's not the billed charges. It's not the amount that's billed out. It is of the
[1:30 - 1:35]  total that they collected in or were expected to collect in, they had to write off 5.6% of that.
[1:35 - 1:44]  Okay, how has that changed over time? Okay, in 2015, it went down by to 4.7. It went to a low of 4.3.
[1:45 - 1:50]  And now it's up a little bit to 4.6 in 2018, which is the most recent year we have the statistics for
[1:50 - 1:57]  that. Okay, so it's down an entire percentage point from 5.6 down to 4.6. Okay, why did that happen?
[1:57 - 2:04]  It happened because of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion, right? Medicaid expansion because
[2:04 - 2:13]  the vast majority of that improvement in uncollected bills was in the fact that you had people that
[2:13 - 2:18]  were uninsured before and not able to pay before, and now you had the state and the federal government
[2:18 - 2:24]  in the form of Medicaid now paying for it. Okay, now keep in mind, this is on an overall
[2:24 - 2:30]  growing pie of net patient revenue. Okay, so it's a small, not only did they have to write off less,
[2:31 - 2:36]  but the pie grew. Okay, so in 2014, total net patient revenue for hospitals nationwide was about
[2:36 - 2:45]  $900 billion, and in 2018, it increased to $1.1 trillion. So it went up by $200 billion. Okay,
[2:45 - 2:51]  so not only is the pie of total revenue growing, but the slice of the pie that they had to write off
[2:51 - 2:56]  was shrinking. So if you're a hospital, that's fantastic news. Okay, now let's put this into
[2:56 - 3:02]  more specific numbers. So for the top 50 largest hospitals by net patient revenue, they earned
[3:02 - 3:11]  $123 billion. Now, so an extra percentage point that they don't have to write off from the 5.6% to
[3:11 - 3:18]  the 4.6%, that's an extra $1.23 billion that those 50 hospitals had. Okay, now keep in mind,
[3:18 - 3:23]  this has nothing to do with charity care. This is totally separate from charity care. This is not
[3:23 - 3:28]  charity care at all. This is stuff where the hospital is trying to get paid, and they didn't
[3:28 - 3:34]  get paid. Not stuff that they're forgiving, because none of this is forgiven in any way. Okay, so
[3:34 - 3:39]  specifically, let's look at some of the largest hospitals by net patient revenue. So New York
[3:39 - 3:46]  Presbyterian, that extra one percentage point of lower write-offs for bad debt would result in an extra
[3:46 - 3:56]  $153 million in 2018. For the Cleveland Clinic, that one percentage point decrease in bad debt
[3:56 - 4:03]  write-offs would equal an extra $49 million. For the Stanford Hospital and healthcare system out on the
[4:03 - 4:09]  West Coast, it would equal an additional $41 million. That's just in one year. If you applied that one
[4:09 - 4:16]  percentage point improvement in bad debt to their net patient revenue for 2018, that's what they would
[4:16 - 4:24]  get in that one year extra. It's like a Christmas present or a birthday present. Now, what could they do
[4:24 - 4:29]  with that? They could give their employees raises. They could build a new capital campaign. They could
[4:29 - 4:37]  switch over and provide more charity care with this money. They could create a free clinic. Shoot, with $53 million,
[4:37 - 4:42]  you could probably create a whole bunch of free clinics for patients. So what's my point for today?
[4:42 - 4:47]  My point for today is that, look, hospitals cannot cry poor. That's my point for today. Hospitals cannot
[4:47 - 4:52]  cry poor, right? So sometimes you'll hear hospitals cry poor and say, well, with all these high deductible
[4:52 - 4:58]  health plans, we can't collect the out-of-pocket costs from these high deductibles. And just, you know,
[4:58 - 5:02]  and I see all these newspaper articles about like lawsuits against people going after their money. Just know
[5:02 - 5:09]  that like that increased out-of-pocket financial responsibility is not hurting the hospitals. It's not. So from a financial
[5:09 - 5:18]  standpoint, like on average, in general, hospitals are doing great. Now, obviously, you've seen stories about rural
[5:18 - 5:26]  hospitals not doing well. But the point is, is that there are many, many, many hospitals that financially are doing
[5:26 - 5:31]  great. And I wanted to share that with you today. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z.
