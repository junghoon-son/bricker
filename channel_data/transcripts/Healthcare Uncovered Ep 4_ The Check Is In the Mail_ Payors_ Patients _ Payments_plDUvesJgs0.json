  "text": " Doctors, do you know how much your patients owe you? It's way more than you think, but there is a way to get to it. Today I'm going to tell you how. I'm Dr. Eric Bricker, and I'm also a healthcare finance expert. I know how doctors get taken advantage of financially, and that's why I've partnered with KnowMeHealth to share with you what I know. This is Healthcare Uncovered. For patients with commercial insurance, out-of-pocket costs now account for almost 20% of doctor revenue. Your patient has commercial insurance. Great! On average, insurance is only going to give you 80% of what you should be paid. The other 20% has to come from the patients themselves. Collecting payments from patients is difficult. Almost 75% of doctors report that it takes over one month to collect patient out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and coinsurance. So even after you have obtained prior authorization, billed the insurance company, and collected payment from the insurance company, the amount is still 20% less than the full allowed amount because of the patient out-of-pocket responsibility. That out-of-pocket percentage has only increased. It's up two percentage points from 10 years ago as a result of more patients having high-deductible health insurance plans through their employer. One practice I spoke with recently in Boston said their number one payer was Blue Cross, and their number two payer was, well, the patients themselves above all other insurance companies. And this practice works with Cigna, UHC, Aetna. But doctors, there are solutions. Work with payers that pay you in full and eliminate your need to collect from the patient. They exist. They are out there. I'm Dr. Eric Bricker, and this is Healthcare Uncovered, where we break down a broken system.",
