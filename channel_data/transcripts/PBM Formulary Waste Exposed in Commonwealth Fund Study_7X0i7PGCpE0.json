  "text": " Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is Commonwealth study on formulary waste. Now this study which was recently published is based on 15 self-funded employee health plans. Many of those employers are actually associated with the Pacific Business Group on Health and they looked at the Rx claims data for these 15 groups specifically around waste in their formularies. In other words, what drugs were on their formularies that were wasteful? And guess what they found? 868 wasteful drugs were on the formulary. Not 8, 868. Okay, what sort of classified a drug as wasteful? Well, if it was a Me Too medication, in other words, it was just a new medication, but it was really no different than an existing medication. It was a combination pill where it was a very expensive brand name pill where the two individual medications, if you took them separately as two pills instead of one, it'd be incredibly cheap. Next, over-the-counter alternatives. In other words, there was a quote-unquote prescription medication. You could just take the thing over the counter. Also, where there were just generic alternatives for like essentially the same thing for the, instead of the expensive brand. Okay, so all that was waste. Okay, what specifically did they find in terms of the quantity of that waste? Well, those wasteful drugs made up 6% of all prescription claims. Okay, so it's a vast minority. However, they constituted anywhere from 3 to 24% of those groups Rx spend. Now, why would it range so much from 3 to 24%? Well, if the group had very few wasteful medications that were actually being filled, then it would be at the low end of savings opportunity. But if they had a high number of prescriptions that fell amongst those 868 wasteful drugs, then if you got people not taking those medications, for those folks, it would be like 24% of their Rx spend. Now, I guarantee you every single employer that is watching this video would like to lower their Rx spend by 24%. Okay, now, let's go over some of the savings. Only eight drugs. It stratifies, right? As in so many things in healthcare, the 80-20 rule, the 550 rule, only eight drugs accounted for 21% of all the savings. We're going to go over those now. So, they were metformin extended release. So, in other words, once a day metformin, which is the most common medication for diabetes, versus just taking it twice a day, which would be much less expensive. Dexalent, which is a very expensive version of what's referred to as a PPI or a heartburn antacid medication. Duexis, which is one of these combo pills for pain. It's a combination of an over-the-counter antacid and ibuprofen. I mean, come on. It's like two incredibly cheap things. This thing costs thousands of dollars a month. Okay. Mometasone, okay, which is essentially the steroid in Nasonex where you could have a generic or even an over-the-counter nasal steroid. Okay. Absorica, which is essentially another form of a pill used to treat acne. Next, we have Soledin, another acne treatment. Again, you could take a pill twice a day instead of the once a day Soledin. It'd be super cheap, and it's the same type. This actually is an antibiotic. It's super cheap. Okay. Esomeprazole. Okay. So, this is essentially the generic version of NXIVM. Again, there's tons of very cheap PPI, heartburn antacid medications that are over-the-counter. And then Jubilee. What's that for? Toenail fungus. An incredibly expensive toenail fungus medication. Okay. Now, so fine. This is not some sort of academic exercise. This commonwealth study specifically says, okay, what would you do to this data? Okay. What you would do with this data is, you would take those 816 trunks off the formulary. Guess what? There's barriers to doing that. And the study calls out those specific barriers. And they're fascinating. Okay. One, the PBM contracts maintain rebate payments off of these expensive medications. In other words, whenever metformin, ER, and dexalan, and duexas are prescribed, the PBM gets paid money by the pharmaceutical company and makes that. So, essentially, if you got rid of those 868 drugs, you'd be hurting the PBM's revenue stream. And so, they have contractual requirements that forbid the employer customers from doing that. Okay. Next up. So, fine. In some cases, maybe you could do that. And all they're going to do is say, okay, well, if we're getting, they being the PBM, if we're going to make less money off of our rebates because you're getting rid of these drugs, then we're just going to jack up your admin fees. Okay. Well, that doesn't really help you as an employer. Okay. Next up. They say consultants themselves are a barrier because consultants are only looking at admin fees and rebate payments. They're not looking at per employee Rx spend. They're not using the right metrics to actually help negotiate on behalf of employers with the PBM's. Okay. Of course, patient experience. If the doctor prescribes the medication and they can't go fill it at the pharmacy because it's not on the formulary, well, then that's going to create some noise in the employee population. Like, we need to address that. Now, is that, can you address that noise? Can you get out ahead of it? Can you help the employees? Of course. But the point is, is that the change will cause some degree of consternation within the employee population. That's going to happen. We need to address that. And then finally, they point out that look, the consulting firms themselves get money from the PBM's. So they have a financial conflict of interest in terms of negotiating in a different, better way with the PBM's because they're getting paid by the PBM's. Okay. So I just want to applaud the Commonwealth. I want to applaud these 15 employers. I want to applaud the Pacific Business Group on Health. This is an incredibly meaningful study. I will leave a link to it in the show notes. It's incredibly articulately, it's incredibly well written. It's actually an incredibly smooth read on a very difficult subject. So please read it. And that's my point for today. Thank you for watching a Healthcare Z.",
