 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker with First Stop Health and today we're going to be discussing health plan innovation is alignment innovation. So this is where the true change in employee health care is happening. And it's happening around alignment or should I say misalignment because fee-first service is total misalignment. So the entire basis for the vast majority of employee health plans in America is fee-for-service. It's not fee-for-quality. It's not fee-for-outcomes. It's not fee-for-health. It's fee-for-service. So you're paying for service. It's in the name. Okay. So how does this create misalignment for the carrier, the doctor, and the hospital vis-a-vis the employee health plan? So one, the carrier has these PPO discounts off of a fictitious dollar amount of billed charges from the hospital. So the more the hospital charges, the more the discount. So you think you're saving money, but the allowed amount is going up at the same time. Okay. There's misalignment. The carrier network actually wants the billed charges to go up because then they can show you even more of a discount while the allowed amount goes up, right? Total misalignment. Number two, the health insurance carriers all own PBMs. Those PBMs are paid a commission by pharmaceutical companies for more and more expensive high-cost drugs, brand-name drugs, specialty drugs. What do I mean? It's called a rebate. Oh, by the way, all those rebate dollars are not passed through. And so the PBM keeps that and they call it a rebate. It's a commission. And even if they don't call it a rebate, let's say they call it administrative fee, it's a commission. So the carrier is aligned with the PBM and the pharmaceutical company for more expensive and more medications to be prescribed to your employees. In fact, I know of a large Midwestern self-funded municipality whose carrier offered them a $0 ASO fee if the carrier could just keep all the rebate money. That's how much money at stake that they were willing to forego all of the money in their traditional ASO revenue model just to keep the rebates. Okay. Next up, doctors are misaligned with an employee health plan because they're paid by pharmaceutical companies. They're not paid in terms of like money directly into their bank accounts, but they're paid like honoraria. Okay. They're paid consulting fees, but these are thinly veiled payments by the pharmaceutical company to the doctor. And I'll leave links for all the references here. More than half of doctors in America accept these payments. Okay. The proceduralists, the surgeons, the gastroenterologists, etc., they have part ownership in the ASCs and the ambulatory surgery centers. So they're getting a cut of facility fee as well. They not only get the professional fee, they get part of the facility fee. That just adds kerosene to the fire fee for service. Okay. More and more doctors are employed by hospitals themselves where the hospitals are driving their quote unquote productivity, which in other words is more fee for service. The hospital is measuring and driving them to do more fee for service. And, oh, by the way, the largest private oncology group in America is owned by a drug distributor. You want to talk about a conflict of interest, these doctors, literally, that see over a million cancer patients a year are owned by a company that distributes the chemotherapy. So they're financially incentivized to prescribe more chemo on the corporate level. Okay. Next up, hospitals totally misaligned with the employee health plan. They have bought physician practices. physician practices, Joe or Jane, doctor, office, and they've turned it into the hospital outpatient department without you even knowing. They don't change the name on the front of the building. All they do is they change the tax ID in the back and all of a sudden they get to bill it like it's a hospital. And so literally that turns like an echocardiogram from a $120 test to an $800 test. Nothing changes. The doctor doesn't change it. The machine doesn't change. The technician doesn't change. The location doesn't change. But just because the hospital bought the practice, they can then bill it as a hospital outpatient department to your commercial insurance plan for $800 instead of $120. Like that, that is their strategy. That is the strategy of misalignment with your employee health plan. Okay. Next. The major hospital systems, they block network steerage by the carrier. So their contract with the insurance carrier says you can't steer people. If we're going to give you a PPO discount, you cannot steer members within that PPO network. That's exactly what Sutter got in trouble with with the state of California. And Becerra, who's now the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, he went after Sutter for exactly that reason. Now, Walmart wanted to steer their employees within their... I'll leave a link to this Walmart article there. Walmart went to their carriers and said, hey, we want to steer employees within your network, carrier. And the carrier said no. The carrier said no to Walmart because their contracts with the major hospital systems forbid them from doing that. So Walmart had to go out on their own and create a steerage tool for their employees. So here you have misalignment where the hospitals don't want the insurance companies steering their members to more high-value providers. And they contractually prohibit them from doing so. So you have misalignment in the old world. But there is good news. And that good news is you can find alignment and you can find alignment by just exiting the system. Like you don't have to bill insurance to provide health care for your employees. You don't have to use the traditional fee for service doctor and hospital systems for your employees. You don't have to do that. There are ways outside of the system for you to exit and still provide care without claims. What a novel concept. You can actually provide care for your employees without creating claims. There's no law that says you have to create a claim. Right? So what does that mean? You provide an on-site clinic for your employees. There's care. There's no claims. It could be a near-site clinic. There's care. There's no claims. It could be direct primary care where you're just paying a subscription fee to that primary care doctor's office. There's no claims. There's no claims. There's just a subscription fee. Next up. It could be a center of excellence. Again, like Walmart getting these bundling payments for various, you know, operations, knee, hip replacements, spine, etc. Like there's no traditional claim with the carrier. They do it completely outside of the carrier. Lastly, virtual virtual care. Many of these services, instead of doing an on-site, near-site, direct primary care, it can be done virtually. That's why I'm so excited about what First Stop Health does. So, obviously I'm biased because I'm the chief medical officer of First Stop Health now, but I wanted to share this with you. If you want to innovate, then align everyone's incentives. It's amazing what happens when everyone gets into alignment. Thank you for watching.
