 Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is six commission relationships in healthcare. Now I've talked about these commissions in various videos but I wanted to put them together in one place so you can see how they all interrelate. So let's go through them now and I'm also going to list the euphemism that the commission is called. So first up we have employee benefits brokers and consultants or insurance brokers and consultants. They're paid a commission by insurance carriers. Now sometimes it's directly called a commission and sometimes it's referred to as an override sort of in addition to the commission. Next up we have PBMs and insurance companies. Now the PBMs are owned by insurance companies so the separation of the two they really need to be put together. Like they should never be talked about separately anymore. Like they're essentially one thing, right? They're paid a commission by pharmaceutical manufacturers. It's not called a commission. It's called a rebate. Next up we have group purchasing organizations that hospitals buy their supplies from. They're paid a commission from medical device companies and medical supply companies. That commission is called an administrative fee. Next up you have the RX switch operators that actually process the transactions between the pharmaceutical companies and, excuse me, between the PBM and the pharmacy. They are paid a commission by the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Now it's part of a quote unquote co-pay program that they have to pay, the pharma companies have to pay a fee to the switch operators for, but it's essentially a commission. Next up we have hospital based doctors. They're paid a commission. It's called a stipend. So this is where the hospitalists like, I used to be a hospitalist. Our hospitalist group got a stipend from the hospital. ER physicians, other hospital based physicians. There are some hospital based physicians where their stipend is even flexed or based upon how much stuff they order. Like CT scans. That totally exists. Next up, just doctors in general are paid a commission by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Now they're called speaker fees. Now I put an asterisk next to this one because this one is illegal against the anti-kickback law. So like Novartis got into the lot of trouble and had to pay over 600 million dollar fine within the last several years for this. So this is expressly illegal. But listen, it still happens. It's called speaker fees, which is a thinly veiled commission paid to the doctor for prescribing the medications. Okay. Now this small chart here on the bottom shows how the patient and the employer who's receiving the care and who's paying for the care, how they then interact with these various commission receiving groups. So on the patient side, obviously they're interacting with the doctor. And that doctor, as I said above, is receiving commissions from the hospital and from pharmaceutical companies. The employer is interacting with their broker benefit consultant and the insurance carrier. Now the insurance carrier is paying commissions to the broker and the insurance carrier is getting commission fees from the pharmaceutical manufacturers. So, listen, and except in the case of number six here, all this stuff is illegal. I'm not saying it's not illegal. And anybody who's bought or sold a house has worked with somebody who works off a commission and that is a realtor. And there's nothing illegal about realtors working off a commission. That's not what I'm saying. One, it needs to be disclosed. Right? So the realtor discloses the commission that they're making and you know exactly how much it is they're going to make. And then number two, this really gets down to the principal agent issue. And I'll leave a link in the show notes to my principal agent video. But essentially the principal is the patient and the employer and the doctor and the broker benefit consultant and the insurance carriers. Those are the agents. Those are the agents acting on behalf of the principal. And you want them to act on the principal's best interest. Okay, great. In a commission type relationship, how do you accomplish that? How do you reconcile the commission with aligning the interests of the principals and the agent? Aha! Great question. And you do that in two ways. One is through competition. So, arguably the broker employer relationship is highly competitive and the employer can go out and get a new broker. Likewise, the insurance carrier employer relationship, it should be competitive. I would argue it should be more competitive. And that if an employer actually put their insurance carrier out to bid every year and they had more options, then the insurance carrier would act as more of an agent on behalf of the principal. Likewise, with a patient, like the patient can vote with their feet. They can just not see that doctor anymore. Now, there are various things that cause problems. So one is just time, right? If it's an emergency, you can't quote unquote shop your physicians. Or if you're in a rural location, you might not have a lot of options. So in addition to competition, number two is regulation. And listen, like it's highly competitive for like realtors with people selling their houses. But there's also regulation for realtors too. Likewise, there are needs, so what's the point? The point is that if doctors or brokers and insurance carriers ever argue against competition or ever argue against regulation, well, they might be arguing against a better principal-agent relationship with patients and employers. And I'd ask you to add whatever other commissions I've left off here. I'm sure there's other ones that I've missed. So leave them in the show notes. And that's my point for today. Thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Thank you.

[0:00 - 0:05]  Hello, this is Dr. Eric Bricker and thank you for watching A Healthcare Z. Today's topic is
[0:05 - 0:12]  six commission relationships in healthcare. Now I've talked about these commissions in
[0:12 - 0:18]  various videos but I wanted to put them together in one place so you can see how they all interrelate.
[0:18 - 0:23]  So let's go through them now and I'm also going to list the euphemism that the commission is
[0:23 - 0:29]  called. So first up we have employee benefits brokers and consultants or insurance brokers
[0:29 - 0:33]  and consultants. They're paid a commission by insurance carriers. Now sometimes it's directly
[0:33 - 0:38]  called a commission and sometimes it's referred to as an override sort of in addition to the commission.
[0:38 - 0:44]  Next up we have PBMs and insurance companies. Now the PBMs are owned by insurance companies so the
[0:44 - 0:49]  separation of the two they really need to be put together. Like they should never be talked about
[0:49 - 0:53]  separately anymore. Like they're essentially one thing, right? They're paid a commission by
[0:53 - 0:58]  pharmaceutical manufacturers. It's not called a commission. It's called a rebate. Next up we have
[0:58 - 1:03]  group purchasing organizations that hospitals buy their supplies from. They're paid a commission
[1:03 - 1:09]  from medical device companies and medical supply companies. That commission is called an administrative
[1:09 - 1:17]  fee. Next up you have the RX switch operators that actually process the transactions between the
[1:17 - 1:24]  pharmaceutical companies and, excuse me, between the PBM and the pharmacy. They are paid a commission by
[1:24 - 1:30]  the pharmaceutical manufacturers. Now it's part of a quote unquote co-pay program that they have to pay,
[1:30 - 1:35]  the pharma companies have to pay a fee to the switch operators for, but it's essentially a commission.
[1:35 - 1:43]  Next up we have hospital based doctors. They're paid a commission. It's called a stipend. So this is where the
